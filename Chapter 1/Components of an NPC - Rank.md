# Rank

NPCs have a single mechanical attribute, their rank. From this, their ability to resist and inflict [[01 Chapter - The Basics#^f66007|harm]] in combat is derived, as follows:

| Rank         | Type                                      | Progress           | Harm            |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Troublesome  | Common enemies                            | 3 progressper harm | Inflicts 1 harm |
| Dangerous    | Capable fighters and deadly creatures     | 2 progressper harm | Inflicts 2 harm |
| Formidable   | Exceptional fighters and mighty creatures | 1 progressper harm | Inflicts 3 harm |
| Extreme      | Foes of overwhelming skill or power       | 2 ticks perharm    | Inflicts 4 harm |
| Epic         | Legendary foes of mythic power            | 1 tick perharm     | Inflicts 5 harm |

When you engage a foe in combat, give them a standard progress track (10 boxes). When you Strike or Clash and inflict harm, mark progress for each point of harm based on the foe’s rank. For example, you mark 2 ticks for each point of harm inflicted on an extreme foe, and 2 progress (2 full boxes) for each point of harm against a dangerous foe.

When you fail to defend against a foe’s attack and face physical harm, you make the [[Endure Harm]] move. As part of that move, you reduce your health track by the amount of harm your foe inflicts, per their rank. If appropriate to the NPC, they can also inflict [[Stress]] equal to their rank when you fail to resist an action which frightens, demoralizes, or rattles you. Use the [[End the Fight]] move, adding your progress against this foe, when you attempt to resolve the combat. See [[01 Chapter - The Basics#^2b5624|progress]] to learn more.

> The ranks for the sample NPCs in this chapter represent a typical individual of that type. For unusually powerful NPCs, increase their rank by one (to a maximum of epic). For less powerful foes, decrease their rank by one (to a minimum of troublesome). You can also adjust the rank of a foe when circumstances give you significant narrative disadvantage or advantage before the fight. See [[The Mechanics and the Fiction#^adjustingrank|adjusting challenge ranks]] for more.

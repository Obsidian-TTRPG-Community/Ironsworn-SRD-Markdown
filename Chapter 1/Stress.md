# Stress
Stress represents mental burdens and trauma. When you face mental shock or despair, make the Endure Stress move (page 95). As part of that move, you reduce your spirit track by the amount of stress suffered. There are five ranks of stress.

>[!tldr] Ranks of Stress
>- Troublesome (1 stress): An unsettling incident or frustrating failure.
>- Dangerous (2 stress): A distressing incident or upsetting failure.
>- Formidable (3 stress): A horrifying incident or demoralizing failure.
>- Extreme (4 stress): A heart-rending incident or traumatic failure.
>- Epic (5 stress): A soul-shattering incident or the loss of all hope.

When you Endure Stress, you reduce your spirit track by the amount of

stress suffered. If you are at 0 spirit, you are in danger of suffering a debility or falling into desolation.

You can recover spirit by relaxing when you Make Camp (page 64), finding fellowship when you Sojourn (page 71), or when you Forge a Bond (page 74).

attempt to frighten or demoralize another character, make an appropriate move to see what happens

# Progress Tracks

A progress track is used to measure your pace and determine the outcome of a goal or challenge in specific situations. ^2b5624

>[!tldr] Progress Tracks
>- When you [[Swear an Iron Vow]], a progress track represents the challenges you overcome on your way to achieving your ultimate goal.
>- When you [[Undertake a Journey]], a progress track represents how far you’ve gone and how favorable the travel has been.
>- When you [[Enter the Fray]], a progress track represents your advantage as you weaken or wound your foes in combat.
>- When you establish a new relationship with a character in your world and [[Forge a Bond]], you mark your bond on a progress track.

Progress tracks are drawn as a row of ten boxes which you fill in—or mark— as you make headway toward a goal. When you initiate a challenge, these boxes are empty.

Since making progress on your quests may stretch over many sessions, your character sheet includes progress tracks for vows. Your character sheet also includes a progress track for your bonds. For journeys and fights, you can sketch out your progress tracks on whatever is convenient, or use the challenge worksheets provided at [ironswornrpg.com](http://www.ironswornrpg.com).

## Challenge Ranks
When you engage in a fight, initiate a journey, or swear a vow, you give your challenge a rank. In increasing order of difficulty, the ranks are troublesome, dangerous, formidable, extreme, and epic. You (or the GM) will choose a rank appropriate to the situation and how quickly or easily it should be resolved. Troublesome is used for simple challenges. A typical challenge is dangerous or formidable. Epic and extreme challenges require great effort and luck to overcome. See guidelines for [[Componants of an NPC#^rank|foes]], and for [[04 Chapter - Your World|journeys]] for more. Give your vows a rank appropriate to the complexity of your quest and the amount of emphasis you want to give the vow in your story.

## Marking Progress
You will perform specific moves to advance toward your goal. For example, as you travel across perilous lands, you Undertake a Journey and mark progress when you successfully reach waypoints in your travel.

Similarly, when you fight, you [[Strike]] or [[Clash]] to inflict harm on your foe. To move forward in your quest, you use the [[Reach a Milestone]] move. These incremental moves let you amass advantages to have the best chance of success when you are ready to resolve your challenge.

Whenever you successfully move toward your goal, you partially or fully fill in a box on your progress track. You fill progress boxes with lines—called ticks. A full progress box consists of four ticks in a star-shaped pattern. When a move tells you to mark progress, fill in the appropriate number of ticks or progress boxes based on the rank of your challenge.

| Rank        | Marks                 |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Troublesome | 3 progress (12 ticks) |
| Dangerous   | 2 progress (8 ticks)  |
| Formidable  | 1 progress (4 ticks)  |
| Extreme     | 2 ticks               |
| Epic        | 1 tick                |

## Marking Progress for Bonds
If you are marking progress on your bonds progress track, you always mark 1 tick unless a move tells you otherwise. [[Chapter 2/Bonds|Bonds]] are not given a challenge rank.

## Progress Moves
>[!tldr] There are four moves, called progress moves, which utilize progress tracks to resolve the outcome of a goal or challenge.
>- To resolve a quest, [[Fulfill Your Vow]].
>- To end your journey, [[Reach Your Destination]].
>- To decide the outcome of combat, [[End the Fight]].
>- When you retire from your life as Ironsworn, [[Write Your Epilogue]]

## Sharing Progress Tracks with Allies
When you and your allies are working together to resolve a challenge—a quest, a journey, or a fight—you share a progress track and mark progress together. When you make a progress move, only one of you rolls the dice. The result will stand for the group.

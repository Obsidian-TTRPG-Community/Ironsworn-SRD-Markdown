# Supply
Supply is an abstract representation of your preparedness, including ammo, food, water, and general upkeep. It is ranked from 0 to +5. Instead of keeping track of a detailed inventory, you can consider most of your mundane gear as covered under supply.

Supply is decreased when you make the [[Undertake a Journey]] move. You might also reduce supply as a narrative cost when you face hardships as an outcome of other moves. For example, if you make the [[Face Danger]] move to ford a wild river, you might lose some gear as a result of a weak hit or miss. Supply is increased when you gather provisions through moves such as [[Resupply]].

The supply track represents the shared assets among your party. You and your allies use the same supply value while you travel together. If any of you make a move to increase supply, or suffer the result of a move that reduces your supply, each of you adjust your supply track accordingly.

When your supply falls to 0, all characters make the [[Out of Supply]] move. If you are at 0 supply and suffer additional -supply, you each must reduce your health, spirit, or momentum tracks by that amount.

	To start, set your supply track to +5. You and your allies share the same supply value while you adventure together. When one of you makes a move that raises or lowers the supply track, each of you should make the adjustment on your character sheet.

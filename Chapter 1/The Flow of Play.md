# The Flow of Play
Like most roleplaying games, you play primarily from the perspective of your character. What are you doing? What are you trying to achieve? What opposition and challenges do you face? Your quests, and the characters and situations you encounter, will guide the fiction and the choices you make.

When you have questions about what you find, how other characters in your world respond, or what happens next, you can go with what feels right (if you’re playing solo or co-op), or ask your GM. When you are seeking inspiration or want to put it in the hands of fate, you make the [[Ask the Oracle]]. Use the yes/no questions and random prompts to generate interesting twists and new complications you might not have thought of on your own.

Above all, if it’s interesting, dramatic and fits the fiction, make it happen. If you are doing something covered by a move, refer to the move to resolve your action. If it tells you to roll dice, do it.

Scoring a strong hit on a move means you are in control. You’re driving the narrative. What do you do next?

A weak hit or a miss means you don’t have control of the situation. Instead of acting, you react. What happens next? If you’re playing with a GM, they’ll determine how the world responds. Otherwise, you rely on your intuition and occasional oracle rolls to drive the narrative.

# Equipment
In Ironsworn, you won’t worry too much about equipment. Your [[Supply|supply track]] is an abstract representation of your general readiness, clothes, ammo, food, water, and mundane gear.

You are armed and armored as appropriate to your vision for your character. If you wield a weapon, you can inflict harm with it. If you are armed with a deadly weapon (such as a sword, axe, spear, or bow), you inflict 2 harm. If you are unarmed or using an improvised or simple weapon (such as a shield, stick, club, staff, or rock), you inflict 1 harm.

Other equipment provides narrative benefit. It enables you to make moves where that gear is important, or perhaps allows you to avoid a move altogether.

>You need to make your way down a steep rock face. Without assistance, you’d make a Face Danger move to see what happens. If you had rope, the climb is not particularly risky or uncertain. In that case, you might skip the move and just narrate the result.

Specific [[assets]] can make equipment more important and relevant to your character. For example, [[Combat Talents]] assets represent your expertise in a particular weapon or fighting style. When you wield an appropriate weapon, you gain the benefit of the asset.

Apart from assets, you can make note of equipment at whatever level of detail you like, but don’t fuss over it. If you’re wondering whether you have a particular mundane item, you can [[Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle]] .

# Assets

Assets are a key component of your character. They give you additional options and bonuses when making a move, and may include their own special moves. When you create your [[You Are Ironsworn|character]], you select your starting

assets. When you [[Fulfill Your Vow]] and gain [[experience]], you can Advance to spend your experience on new assets or upgrade current [[Assets, Chapter 2|assets]].

	You can mix-and-match assets however you like. There are no designated assets based on character classes or roles. However, you should avoid picking the same asset as another player.

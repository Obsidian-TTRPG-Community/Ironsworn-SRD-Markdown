## Asset Types
There are four types of assets: Companions, paths, combat talents, and rituals. You can mix-and-match assets as you like—whatever fits your vision for your character and their experiences and goals.
### Companions

^companions

Companions are your NPC helpers. When you acquire a companion, give them a name and envision their appearance and personality. If they don’t have a starting ability, choose one. Upgrading a companion enables additional abilities.

Companions utilize a health track and may suffer harm as a result of one of your moves. When your companion takes damage, make the [[Companion Endure Harm]] move to determine the outcome.

### Paths
Paths represent your background, interests, training, and skills. They provide mechanical and narrative advantages, but also reflect who you are and how you interact with the world. For example, a Ritualist would likely have a different outlook than a Veteran. Choosing both those paths can reflect an evolution of your character or an interesting background.

### Rituals
Magic in Ironsworn is cast through rituals which help support your actions or act as unique moves. Like all assets, rituals can be selected as you gain experience and can be upgraded over time to make them more flexible or powerful.

All rituals utilize a move as their default marked ability. You must make this move and the associated action roll to trigger the effect. Any secondary abilities you gain by upgrading the asset are dependent on performing the ritual described as the default ability.

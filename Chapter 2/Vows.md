# Vows
When you [[Swear an Iron Vow]], you give it a rank (troublesome, dangerous, formidable, extreme, or epic), and record it on your character sheet. You then use a vow progress track to mark when you [[Reach a Milestone]].

>You should start your first session with two vows: A long term goal (your background vow) and an immediate situation which must be dealt with (your inciting incident). You’ll find quest starters in [[04 Chapter - Your World|chapter 4]] - ‘Your World’ and [[05 Chapter - Foes and Encounters|chapter 5]] - ‘Foes and Encounters’.

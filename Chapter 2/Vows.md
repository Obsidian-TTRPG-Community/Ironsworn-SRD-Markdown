# Vows
When you [[Swear an Iron Vow]], you give it a rank (troublesome, dangerous, formidable, extreme, or epic), and record it on your character sheet. You then use a vow progress track to mark when you [[Reach a Milestone]].

	You should start your first session with two vows: A long term goal (your background vow) and an immediate situation which must be dealt with (your inciting incident). You’ll find quest starters in chapter 4 - ‘Your World’ (page 111) and chapter 5 - ‘Foes and Encounters’ (page 133).

	To learn more about your starting vows, see page 195.

# Bonds
As you build relationships and complete quests in the service of others, you create bonds by making the [[Forge a Bond]] move.

Bonds provide narrative texture to your world by fleshing out other characters and communities. They give you places to return to, and people to reconnect with, when your life as Ironsworn has taken its toll. Bonds also provide mechanical benefits when you act within a community or interact with someone with whom you share a bond. For example, the [[Sojourn]] move gives you a bonus to your action roll if you have a bond with that community.

The bonds progress track on your character sheet represents the connections you have made. When you successfully Forge a Bond, you mark progress (one tick). When your time as Ironsworn is done, you [[Write Your Epilogue]]. When you make that move, you tally the number of filled boxes on your bonds progress track as your progress score. See [[Progress Tracks]] to learn more about its moves.

You should start your first session with up to three background bonds. Make a note of the people or communities you share bonds with, and mark up to three ticks on your bond progress track. See [[Mark your Background Bonds]] to learn more about your first session and starting bonds.

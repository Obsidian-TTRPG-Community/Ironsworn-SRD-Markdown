# Experience
When you [[Fulfill Your Vow]], you gain experience. The amount of experience is based on the rank of the quest, and ranges from 1 to 5 points. Mark an ‘X’ on your character sheet for each point you’ve earned.

When you [[Advance]], you spend experience to purchase assets or upgrade an asset. Replace the ‘X’ for each point spent with a filled-in dot.

>[!tldr] Per the Advance move, you may:
>- Add a new asset by spending 3 experience.
>- Upgrade an asset by spending 2 experience.

	To start, your experience is unmarked.

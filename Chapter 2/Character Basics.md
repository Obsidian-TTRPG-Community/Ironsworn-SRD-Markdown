# Character Basics
## Name
You have a name. Perhaps others will honor it someday in stories and songs.

> Give your character a name. For inspiration, you can roll on the Ironlander Names tables; [[Ironlander Male Names|male]] and [[Ironlander Female Names|female]].
## ![[Stats]]
## Health
Health represents your current physical condition and stamina, ranked from 0 to +5. Health is reduced when you [[Endure Harm]], and increased when you rest or receive care through moves such as [[Heal]] or [[Sojourn]].

If you are at 0 health, scoring a miss when you Endure Harm puts you at risk of suffering a debility or dying.

	To start, set your health track to +5.
## Spirit
Spirit is your current mental state, ranked from 0 to +5. Spirit is reduced when you [[Endure Stress]]. It is increased when you find comfort in companionship, success, or relaxed moments through moves such as [[Make Camp]] or [[Forge a Bond]].

If you are at 0 spirit, scoring a miss when you [[Endure Stress]] puts you at risk of suffering a debility or falling into desolation.

	To start, set your spirit track to +5.

## Momentum
Momentum represents how you are faring in your quests. It is gained and lost through moves. If you have positive momentum, you are building on your successes and ready to make decisive moves. If you have negative momentum, you have suffered setbacks and your quest is in jeopardy.

See [[Momentum]] to learn more about how it helps and hinders your character.

Use the momentum track on the left side of your character sheet to record your current momentum. Your character sheet also includes boxes to mark your max momentum and momentum reset.

See [[Debilities]] to learn more.

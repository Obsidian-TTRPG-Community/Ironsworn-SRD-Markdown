# Debilities
As you suffer hardships and setbacks in your quests, you may need to mark debilities as a result of moves or narrative events. Moves will tell you which debility to mark, or give you a choice. Debilities represent temporary, longterm, and permanent disadvantages. Some can be easily cleared through an appropriate move. Others will forever become a part of your character.

Debilities should have a narrative impact on how you envision your character’s actions and how others react to you. They also have a mechanical impact by reducing your momentum track.

>[!tldr] Debilities
>- Each marked debility reduces your max momentum by 1.
>- If you have one marked debility, your momentum reset is +1 instead of +2.
>- If you have more than one marked debility, your momentum reset is 0.

## Banes
>[!tldr] Banes
>- Maimed may be marked when you are at 0 health and fail to [[Endure Harm]]. You have suffered a wound which causes you ongoing physical challenges, such as the loss of an eye or hand. Or, you bear horrific scars which serve as a constant reminder of your failures.
>- Corrupted may be marked when you are at 0 spirit and fail to [[Endure Stress]]. Your experiences have left you emotionally scarred. You are at the threshold of losing yourself to darkness.

Banes are permanent. They forever impact your character through the momentum penalty and—more importantly—through the narrative impact of being maimed or corrupted. You should factor this debility into how you perform moves and how you interact with the world. You may have physical or emotional limitations you must cope with. Your outlook may change. Your goals and methods may change. How others behave toward you may change.

If you are maimed, envision the injury and make note of it. Consider how this impacts your approach when facing physical challenges, and weave it into your roleplaying and the narrative of your moves.

When you are corrupted, envision how this impacts your personality and motivations. You might struggle with a new compulsion, quirk, or fear. You might even bear a physical, supernatural sign of the corruption. If so, what is it?

## Burdens
>[!tldr] Burdens
>- Cursed is marked when you [[Face Death]] and return with a soul-bound quest. This burden can only be cleared by completing the quest.
>- Tormented is marked when you [[Face Desolation]] and undertake a quest to prevent a dire future.

Burdens are a result of life-changing experiences that leave you bound to quests. Clearing a burden can only be accomplished by resolving the quest.

When you are cursed or tormented, you should consider the physical or emotional manifestations of these conditions. You have walked the lands beyond death or suffered visions of your greatest fears. What signs do you bear? How do these experiences affect your relationships?

	When you create your character, all debilities should be unmarked.

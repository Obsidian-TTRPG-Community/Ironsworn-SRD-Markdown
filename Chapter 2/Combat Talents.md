### Combat Talents ^combattalents
Ironsworn characters are assumed to be skilled fighters. Even without a combat talent, you can wield weapons and perform [[Combat Moves]]. A combat talent reflects a particular area of expertise, and gives you additional options and bonuses.

Combat talent assets typically require you to wield a specific weapon, as noted in the asset text. For example, if you are a [[Shield-Bearer]] and don’t have a shield at the ready, you can’t use the asset’s abilities.

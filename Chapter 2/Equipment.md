# Equipment
Make note of any important equipment or items you start with. These are things that might impact the narrative and the moves you make, or provide texture to your character’s background. They don’t offer mechanical bonuses unless they are represented by an asset, such as a weapon used in a combat talent.

You can assume you are equipped for travel and adventure as represented by your supply track. Don’t worry about managing rations or ammo or other mundane necessities.

There are no limitations by the rules, but envision your character’s place in society and consider the availability of resources in your version of the Ironlands. By default, a fine sword or a set of quality armor is rare, and marks you as someone of note. It influences how others react to you in the fiction of your game.

If you want to begin your adventures as a typical Ironlander, envision yourself outfitted with cheap, mundane gear. A hand-me-down set of quilted armor. A ratty traveling cloak. A battered wooden shield. A spear and a worn knife. Improving your lot in life can be part of your narrative journey.

>To start, make note of any items which have a narrative impact and equipment which relates to your assets. Keep it simple.

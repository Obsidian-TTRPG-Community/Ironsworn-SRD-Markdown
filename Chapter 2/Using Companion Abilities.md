## Using Companion Abilities
If you have a companion, leveraging their abilities is an option, not a requirement. Through the fiction, you can interact with your companion and have them perform tasks or assist you without using one of the asset abilities. For example, a Horse companion can put you in position to travel at speed or get away from danger.

When you leverage a companionâ€™s ability, you are inherently putting them at risk. If you roll a 1 on your action die when aided by a companion, any negative outcome of the move should involve your companion. Depending on the circumstances, they might suffer harm, be put in danger, become separated from you, or refuse your commands

### Inflicting Harm on Companions
When a companion suffers physical damage, you make the [[Companion Endure Harm]] move. When their health is at 0, they are in danger of being killed. Some moves, such as [[Sojourn]]  and [[Make Camp]] offer options for your companion to recover health.

### Slain Companions
If your companion is killed, give yourself 1 experience point for each marked ability. Then, remove the asset. If you acquire the same type of companion through the narrative of your quest and journeys, you can rebuy the asset at the normal cost.

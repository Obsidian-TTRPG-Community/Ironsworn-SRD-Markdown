# Becoming Ironsworn
In your first session, envision your current situation. Something has happened—or is about to happen—which puts you on the path of the Ironsworn. This is your inciting incident. Make it personal. Give it teeth. It’s not a situation you can just walk away from. You must set things right.

If you need inspiration for this starting situation, have a look at the prompts for vows in chapter 4 - ‘[[04 Chapter - Your World|Your World]]’ and chapter 5 - ‘[[05 Chapter - Foes and Encounters|Foes and Encounters]]’ . Or, you can [[Ask the Oracle]] and interpret the meaning of the answer.

See [[07 Chapter - Gameplay in Depth|Gameplay in Depth]] to learn more about starting your campaign. Then, [[Swear an Iron Vow]] and play to see what happens.

## Next Steps
Depending on the result of your Swear an Iron Vow move, your character may have a clear path forward, may have more questions than answers, or may need to overcome an immediate obstacle or threat before they can undertake their quest. You, as the player or GM, interpret what this result means. Not sure where to begin? Ask the Oracle.

>You’ve sworn your vow and scored a strong hit, which means the next steps—from your character’s perspective—are clear. As the player you don’t know where to begin. Are there any clues to the source of the sickness? You Ask the Oracle by rolling on the [[Action]] and [[Theme]] tables.
>
>The oracle answers, “Leave” and “Trade.” What does it mean? Your first instinct is to interpret this answer as having something to do with a trade caravan. Perhaps one left your village on the same day the overseer fell ill? There must be a connection.
>
>With your immediate goal in sight, you can roleplay your preparations and [[Undertake a Journey]] to set off after the caravan.

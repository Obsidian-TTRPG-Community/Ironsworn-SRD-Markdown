# Mark your Background Bonds

Give yourself up to three [[Chapter 2/Bonds|bonds]]. These bonds may be to a community or an individual. You do not need to make the Forge a Bond move for these starting bonds. Mark a tick for each bond on your character sheet (1 tick per bond), and make note of them.

If you are playing guided or co-op, you can use these starting bonds as your connection to other player characters. Otherwise, you may establish bonds with those characters though play.

If you’d rather jump right into play, you can flesh out the details of your background bonds later. Consider these bonds held in reserve until you decide to bring them into your narrative. If you later introduce a background bond for a character or community, mark the bond. Then, envision how this bond was previously established and how this relationship impacts your story.
>[!example]-
>You mark one bond for your home village. You also envision an NPC, the clan overseer, who is a good and loyal friend. She is one of the few who knows of your former life as a raider, but does not hold it against you. “We can remake ourselves,” she once told you. “Like a broken sword reforged.” You give her a name and mark the bond.
>
>You don’t have any ideas for your third bond, so you keep it in reserve. You can allocate it as you explore your starting situation.
>
>You decide the background bond with the overseer fulfills the requirement of the Banner-Sworn asset (“When you mark a bond with a leader or faction”). You take it as your third and final asset.

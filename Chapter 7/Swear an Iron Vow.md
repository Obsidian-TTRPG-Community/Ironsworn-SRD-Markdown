# Swear an Iron Vow
To set your quest in motion, as a response to the inciting incident, [[Quest Moves|make this move]]. But first, start with the fiction. Envision the scene. Describe what you say and how you perform the ceremony. This is an important moment for your character.

>[!question] What was the result of your move?
>- Did you score a strong hit? Envision your first steps. Do you Undertake a Journey? Do you Compel someone into action? Play to see what happens next, and make moves as appropriate.
>- Did you score a weak hit? Your next steps are unclear. This may typically lead to new scenes and new moves. Perhaps you [[Gather Information]] as you try to identify a path forward.
>- Did you score a miss? An unexpected danger or obstacle stands in your way. Envision what it is, or [[Ask the Oracle]]. Then, play to see what happens as you attempt to overcome this stumbling block. For an inciting incident, give your new vow a rank of troublesome, dangerous, or formidable.

>[!example]-
>You envision the scene as you kneel before your overseer. You curl your hands tight around the iron blade of your sword—so tight that you open a cut in your palm. You pay the wound no mind. The blood fuels the promise. “I will see you healed,” you say. “I swear it.”
>
>You roll the dice. Because you have the Banner-Sworn asset and serve the overseer, you may reroll any dice. It’s a strong hit. A good omen. You write your vow on your character sheet and give it a rank of dangerous. Per the move outcome, “you are emboldened and it is clear what you must do next.” What do you know about this disease? What’s your likely path forward? Envision the answer, talk it out, or [[Ask the Oracle]].

## Sharing Your Vow with Allies
If you are playing with allies, only one of you will make the Swear an Iron Vow move. Other players can make the [[Aid your Ally]] move as a way of representing their own commitment to this vow. If you share this quest with your allies, each of you write the vow and any progress is marked by all players.

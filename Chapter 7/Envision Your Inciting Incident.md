## Envision Your Inciting Incident
An inciting incident is the problem which arrives at the beginning of a story, propelling the protagonist into action. Everything up to that point is backstory—the normal world to which your character has become accustomed. In Ironsworn, the inciting incident is the tipping point which forces you to undertake a life of perilous quests and adventure.

To start your character’s story, envision an imminent threat or compelling need. You can use a quest starter from this book (see chapters 4 and 5), talk it out at the table, or [[Ask the Oracle]]. This problem dictates what drives your first session and sets your character’s story in motion.

>[!question] What makes a good inciting incident?
>- **Make it personal**. Why is this important to your character? Envision how this connects to your background and motivations. Also, consider how you can leverage story themes which are interesting to you as the player.
>- **Make it a problem that won’t go away on its own**. The threats or forces at the heart of this situation will see it through, even if you ignore them.
>- **Give it a ticking clock**. The problem won’t wait for you. If you don’t act or encounter delays, things will get worse.
>- **Make it universal**. If you are playing with allies, make this a shared vow important to each of you. This creates an opportunity to work together. If you are playing solo, make it a threat which impacts other people you care about.
>- **Up the stakes**. Envision complications which make your inciting incident even more dire for you, your family, or your community.
>- **Limit the scope**. Unlike your background vow, this is a problem which you can (and must!) deal with now. In gameplay turns, you Swear an Iron Vow and mark it as a troublesome, dangerous, or formidable quest. If all goes well, it might be resolved in a session or two. If you don’t act, things will get worse.

These suggestions can apply to any vow, but are especially relevant for an inciting incident. Even if the details are not clear to you, envision how the problem can lend itself to a rich narrative full of drama, conflict, and surprises.

>[!example]-
>A mysterious sickness has struck Cinderhome’s overseer. The village healer brewed draughts, but none offered any relief. The priest prayed, but the gods did not listen. The mystic performed divinations, but the shadows did not divulge their secrets.
>
>The overseer, your friend, is fading. Without help, she will surely die. To add a bit more drama and stakes, the families in your community are now at each other’s throats as they start to position their preferred candidate to take up the iron circlet. If the overseer dies, open conflict may break out. The community will be weakened and may not survive the coming winter.

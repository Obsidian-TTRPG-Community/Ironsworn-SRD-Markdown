## Creating a Quest Outline
If you find it helpful, you can envision and write down the main narrative steps in your quest. What journeys must you undertake? Which enemies will oppose you? What information must be found? Who do you need help from?

Your outline should give you ideas for the scenes and challenges which can be part of your quest, with each major step an opportunity to make the [[Reach a Milestone]] move. However, you should consider it a sketchy, unreliable plan at best. It is like an ancient map with “here there be monsters” written in blank spaces.

If you are a GM and have some ideas for challenges and events in the quest, make note of them. However, don’t get locked into a specific path which must be followed. Whether you are a GM or a player, leave yourself open to

surprises, new ideas, input from others at your table, and the whims of fate. Be prepared to toss even the mostly loosely defined plan out the window. Put simply, play to see what happens.

>You consider the steps you’ll take to Fulfill Your Vow. You need to find the caravan, identify the cause of the illness, locate a cure, and return back to Cinderhome to heal the Overseer. You write the milestones down.

>In your outline, you include a note about a healer in the Tanglewood forest. You like the idea of a woodland adventure and a mysterious old herbalist who may want something in exchange for a cure. Your story might not lead in that direction, but it gives you an interesting potential narrative checkpoint.

>That’s four milestones, which is about right for a dangerous quest (two progress per milestone). But, these may change depending on where the story takes you. At the moment, much is unknown.

# Create Your World
If you are playing in the Ironlands or a similar setting, work through the ''[[Your Truth]]'. Review the options and make selections. Keep an eye out for quest starters which trigger an idea for a [[Write your Background Vow|background vow]] or an [[Envision Your Inciting Incident|inciting incident]].

Next, choose where your story begins. Have a look at the [[Regions of the Ironlands]]. Where are your characters located? Are they part of a community, or wandering the wilderness? Talk it out with other players and envision the setting. Mark the location on your map.

>You envision some basic characteristics of your home village. It is a small settlement along the southern fringes of the Havens. It is surrounded by fields and sits astride a wide river.
>
>You roll on the [[Quick Settlement Name Generator]] table, and the oracle answers, “Cinderhome.” You envision the burnt ruins of the former longhouse. It is a place haunted by a long-dead overseer who died in the fire.

>You mark Cinderhome on your map. This is where Saskia’s adventures begins.

If you prefer, you can just spend a few moments defining some basic facts for your world. Jump in and discover the rest in play.

If you are using your own setting or one drawn from another source (such as an RPG, book, or film), you can leverage the information on that setting to determine your character’s situation and the troubles you may encounter.

## Collaborating to Build Your World
If you are playing a co-op or guided campaign, you should work through the initial process of worldbuilding with the other players. Depending on your preferences, you can spend a few minutes quickly roughing out the basics of your setting, or you can dive deep for an hour or two of collaborative creation. Talk it over with the other players to ensure you have the same expectations for your initial session. Even if you give this initial activity some focus, leave open questions and blank spaces to fill in through play.

If you are the GM, you should facilitate discussion and contribute to the worldbuilding. Take cues from the players and make suggestions to help formulate potential quests and adversaries.

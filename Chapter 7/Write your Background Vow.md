# Write your Background Vow
When you create your character, you give yourself a background vow to represent a primary motivation or ultimate goal. This vow is part of your character’s backstory. It may be a vow sworn years ago, or one which is a reaction to some recent, major event.

Write down this vow and give it a rank of extreme or epic. You don’t need to make the Swear an Iron Vow move for this quest.

Fulfilling this vow will not be easy. In story-time, it might require months, years, or even decades to see this vow fulfilled or forsaken. You may even decide your background vow isn’t something you make significant progress on in your narrative. Instead, it just helps establish some roleplaying detail for your character and fleshes out your world.

>[!example]-
>Your backstory involves your former life as a raider. Haunted by your past, you have sworn to see this raider clan defeated. However, there are complications. The clan is powerful, and you couldn’t possibly hope to defeat them without an army at your back. Also, the clan is led by your own mother. It’ll take a special sort of courage to face her again. 
>
>You envision the clan’s name: “Red Moon.” Their shields are decorated with a blood-red circle.

>For now, this vow is a glowing ember, a promise not yet sparked to flame. You mark the vow as “Defeat the Red Moon clan”, giving it a rank of extreme.

# Starting Your Campaign

An Ironsworn campaign is a series of connected game sessions. You will explore your world and the life of your character as you swear vows and struggle to see them fulfilled. You will journey across the Ironlands, run afoul of troubles, fight fearsome foes, and form bonds with people and communities. Through it all, you make decisions as your character and explore what it means to be Ironsworn in a harsh land.

To get started on your campaign, follow the steps described in this section.
## Create Your Character 
Refer to the [[character creation summary]]. Envision your character, considering their motivations, skills, background, appearance, personality, and connections to the world. Set your stats and pick your assets in whatever order you prefer. Give your character a name.

If you are playing co-op or guided, talk over your character with the other players and establish your connections to each other. You can shorthand your ideas for now, and flesh them out in play.

Feel free to intermix world creation and character creation. The choices you make about your setting may determine the options available to your character. Is magic unknown in this world? If so, you may want to ignore the ritual assets.

>[!example]-
>You envision your character. Your family was part of a raider clan. You were born to battle, but left that life behind long ago. Now, you live as a farmer. Your sword, long unused, hangs above the mantle in your modest home. Your armor is stored in a chest at the foot of your bed. Only those closest to you are aware of your former life among the raiders. Others know you for your loyalty to the village and your stubborn determination to help see them through the unforgiving winters. In quiet moments, your dark mood betrays the shadows of your past.
>
>You set your stats. Your iron is 3, representing your strength, prowess in battle, and fierce resolve. Then, 2 for heart and wits, and 1 for edge and shadow. For your assets, you choose Shield-Bearer and Veteran. You’re not sure about your third asset, so you decide to pick it once you are further along in creating your world and starting situation.
>
>Finally, you give your character a name: Saskia
## Create Your World
If you are playing in the Ironlands or a similar setting, work through the ''[[Your Truth]]'. Review the options and make selections. Keep an eye out for quest starters which trigger an idea for a [[Write your Background Vow|background vow]] or an [[Envision Your Inciting Incident|inciting incident]].

Next, choose where your story begins. Have a look at the regions on page 112. Where are your characters located? Are they part of a community, or wandering the wilderness? Talk it out with other players and envision the setting. Mark the location on your map.
>[!example]-
>You envision some basic characteristics of your home village. It is a small settlement along the southern fringes of the Havens. It is surrounded by fields and sits astride a wide river.
>
>You roll on the [[Settlement Name table]], and the oracle answers, “Cinderhome.” You envision the burnt ruins of the former longhouse. It is a place haunted by a long-dead overseer who died in the fire.
>
>You mark Cinderhome on your map. This is where Saskia’s adventures begins.

If you prefer, you can just spend a few moments defining some basic facts for your world. Jump in and discover the rest in play.

If you are using your own setting or one drawn from another source (such as an RPG, book, or film), you can leverage the information on that setting to determine your character’s situation and the troubles you may encounter.

### Collaborating to Build Your World
If you are playing a co-op or guided campaign, you should work through the initial process of worldbuilding with the other players. Depending on your preferences, you can spend a few minutes quickly roughing out the basics of your setting, or you can dive deep for an hour or two of collaborative creation. Talk it over with the other players to ensure you have the same expectations for your initial session. Even if you give this initial activity some focus, leave open questions and blank spaces to fill in through play.

If you are the GM, you should facilitate discussion and contribute to the worldbuilding. Take cues from the players and make suggestions to help formulate potential quests and adversaries.
## ![[Mark your Background Bonds]]
## ![[Write your Background Vow]]
## ![[Envision Your Inciting Incident]]
## Set the Scene
You have two options for starting play: You can begin with the normal world, or in media res.

### The Normal World
Envision a prologue involving your character which helps to flesh out who you are and how you interact with your world. If you have allies, this is an opportunity to roleplay your relationships and introduce your personality and backgrounds. Your inciting incident can then serve as an event or threat which you encounter in play during your first session.

>[!example]-
>You want to spend a bit of time exploring your character and your world before you kick things off with your overseer’s sudden illness. Your village is celebrating the spring festival, and you are taking part in a boar hunting competition. You roleplay scenes and make moves as you interact with other hunters, track your quarry, and attempt to bring down a particularly large and vicious boar. When you return to the village, you learn that the overseer has fallen ill.

If you are having trouble coming up with your initial quest, you can use the prologue to jump in and discover a dramatic situation through play. Ask questions about the characters, your world, and the current situation. Draw conclusions to those questions or Ask the Oracle. Look for opportunities in the fiction to trigger a vow.

### In Media Res
In media res is a Latin term meaning “in the middle of things.” You start your story at a crucial point. Your inciting incident is happening now, or is something you are fully aware of and must react to. The raiders are attacking. The usurper claims the iron circlet. The marauding beast appears.

You can begin with a tense, action-oriented scene as you encounter the problem. Or, you might frame a scene where you Swear an Iron Vow, letting the result of that move trigger what happens next.
>[!example]-
>You envision a scene in the longhouse as you visit your stricken overseer. She lies in bed, her features as pale as death, her breathing ragged. There are others here: The village healer, the overseer’s wife, and a rival who feigns concern. Ignoring them, you stride forward. You draw your sword...
## Swear an Iron Vow
To set your quest in motion, as a response to the inciting incident, [[Quest Moves|make this move]]. But first, start with the fiction. Envision the scene. Describe what you say and how you perform the ceremony. This is an important moment for your character.

>[!question] What was the result of your move?
>- Did you score a strong hit? Envision your first steps. Do you Undertake a Journey? Do you Compel someone into action? Play to see what happens next, and make moves as appropriate.
>- Did you score a weak hit? Your next steps are unclear. This may typically lead to new scenes and new moves. Perhaps you [[Gather Information]] as you try to identify a path forward.
>- Did you score a miss? An unexpected danger or obstacle stands in your way. Envision what it is, or [[Ask the Oracle]]. Then, play to see what happens as you attempt to overcome this stumbling block. For an inciting incident, give your new vow a rank of troublesome, dangerous, or formidable.

>[!example]-
>You envision the scene as you kneel before your overseer. You curl your hands tight around the iron blade of your sword—so tight that you open a cut in your palm. You pay the wound no mind. The blood fuels the promise. “I will see you healed,” you say. “I swear it.”
>
>You roll the dice. Because you have the Banner-Sworn asset and serve the overseer, you may reroll any dice. It’s a strong hit. A good omen. You write your vow on your character sheet and give it a rank of dangerous. Per the move outcome, “you are emboldened and it is clear what you must do next.” What do you know about this disease? What’s your likely path forward? Envision the answer, talk it out, or [[Ask the Oracle]].

### Sharing Your Vow with Allies
If you are playing with allies, only one of you will make the Swear an Iron Vow move. Other players can make the [[Aid your Ally]] move as a way of representing their own commitment to this vow. If you share this quest with your allies, each of you write the vow and any progress is marked by all players.
## Next Steps
Depending on the result of your Swear an Iron Vow move, your character may have a clear path forward, may have more questions than answers, or may need to overcome an immediate obstacle or threat before they can undertake their quest. You, as the player or GM, interpret what this result means. Not sure where to begin? Ask the Oracle.

>[!example]-
>You’ve sworn your vow and scored a strong hit, which means the next steps—from your character’s perspective—are clear. As the player you don’t know where to begin. Are there any clues to the source of the sickness? You Ask the Oracle by rolling on the [[Action]] and [[Theme]] tables.
>
>The oracle answers, “Leave” and “Trade.” What does it mean? Your first instinct is to interpret this answer as having something to do with a trade caravan. Perhaps one left your village on the same day the overseer fell ill? There must be a connection.
>
>With your immediate goal in sight, you can roleplay your preparations and [[Undertake a Journey]] to set off after the caravan.
## Creating a Quest Outline
If you find it helpful, you can envision and write down the main narrative steps in your quest. What journeys must you undertake? Which enemies will oppose you? What information must be found? Who do you need help from?

Your outline should give you ideas for the scenes and challenges which can be part of your quest, with each major step an opportunity to make the [[Reach a Milestone]] move. However, you should consider it a sketchy, unreliable plan at best. It is like an ancient map with “here there be monsters” written in blank spaces.

If you are a GM and have some ideas for challenges and events in the quest, make note of them. However, don’t get locked into a specific path which must be followed. Whether you are a GM or a player, leave yourself open to

surprises, new ideas, input from others at your table, and the whims of fate. Be prepared to toss even the mostly loosely defined plan out the window. Put simply, play to see what happens.

>[!example]-
>You consider the steps you’ll take to Fulfill Your Vow. You need to find the caravan, identify the cause of the illness, locate a cure, and return back to Cinderhome to heal the Overseer. You write the milestones down.
>
>In your outline, you include a note about a healer in the Tanglewood forest. You like the idea of a woodland adventure and a mysterious old herbalist who may want something in exchange for a cure. Your story might not lead in that direction, but it gives you an interesting potential narrative checkpoint.
>
>That’s four milestones, which is about right for a dangerous quest (two progress per milestone). But, these may change depending on where the story takes you. At the moment, much is unknown.
## Campaign Setup Summary
> [!tldr] Campaign Setup Summary
> 1. [[07 Chapter - Gameplay in Depth|Create your character]]. Envision your character. Choose your name, set your stats, and select your assets. Refer to [[02 Chapter - Your Character|chapter 2]] for details. If you prefer, you can start by creating your world (below).
> 2. Create your world (page 194). If you are playing in the Ironlands, refer to [[04 Chapter - Your World|chapter 4]] and the ‘Your Truths’ exercise (page 122). Otherwise, establish the basic truths of your own world. Envision where your story will begin and mark it on your map.
> 3. Create your background bonds (page 195). Mark up to three bonds to represent your connections to home, friends, family, or other loyalties. Make note of these bonds, and mark a tick for each.
> 4. Write your background vow (page 195). Create a sworn quest as backstory for your character. Write down this vow and give it a rank of extreme or epic. You don’t need to make the Swear an Iron Vow move for this quest.
> 5. Envision your inciting incident (page 196). Come up with the problem that drives your character into action.
> 6. Set the Scene (page 198). Decide whether you want to start with a prologue (the normal world), or in the midst of the problem (in media res). Envision the scene and begin play.
> 7. Swear an Iron Vow (page 199). Make the move and write down your vow. Give it a rank of troublesome, dangerous, or formidable.
> 8. Take your next steps (page 200). Based on the outcome of your Swear an Iron Vow move, envision what you do or what happens next. If you like, you may outline the milestones of your adventure. Then, play to see what happens.

# ![[The Mechanics and the Fiction]]
# ![[Managing Your Quests]]
# ![[Principles]]
# Gameplay Options
## Number of Players
Ironsworn is intended primary for small group play. One to four players (plus a GM in guided play) is about right. The examples in this book primarily default to solo play, but the rules are the same for more players and guided play.

For combat scenes with three or more player characters, consider a couple of factors:

- Don’t rely on initiative to manage the spotlight. Even if a player is on a roll with strong hits, jump to someone else and keep it moving around the table. Use transitions from player to player at key moments as a way to heighten the drama and allow others to react to what just happened or is about to happen.

- Since every character can inflict harm and mark progress on a shared progress track, enemies will be easier to take down. To offset this, increase the rank or number of your foes. You can divide multiple foes among the characters instead of grouping those foes into packs.
### Adjusting the Impact of Matches
More players tend to add more rolls to your session. This creates more matches, which can be challenging to interpret or start to feel routine. If you want to make matches feel more unusual and special, use this option:

Resolve the impact of a match only when your challenge dice come up as an even number (2, 4, 6, 8, or 10).
## One-Shot Play
If you want to run a single, self-contained session of Ironsworn, here’s what to do. This process is a simplification of the campaign setup on page 202.
>[!note]
>1. Introduce the world. If you are the GM or are facilitating the session, briefly describe the setting. You can play in the Ironlands (page 111), or introduce your own setting. Don’t worry about the details. You can flesh it out in play.
2. Create characters. Each player creates their character by setting stats and picking assets. Give your character a name, and consider some basic aspects of their look and personality. You can ignore background vows and bonds. Work together to decide how your characters are connected.
3. Introduce the inciting incident. If you are the GM or facilitator, you can come prepared with an inciting incident (page 196) and quest outline (page 200). Otherwise, you can work together to envision a story problem (or Ask the Oracle). You might consider introducing the inciting incident as part of character creation to help determine the relationship between the characters.
4. Set the scene. Decide where your adventure starts, and begin play in media res (page 198).
5. Swear an Iron Vow. Give your quest a rank of troublesome (for a session of an hour or two) or dangerous (for a session of three to four hours).
To give your story a satisfying conclusion, your target for the session is to resolve the quest and see the vow fulfilled or forsaken. Adjust the pace of your milestones and the detail of your scenes as appropriate for the time you have available. Focus on what is interesting, and zoom out or abstract what is unimportant. Use the Battle move to quickly resolve combat with secondary NPCs, saving detailed combat for climactic fights.
## Opposing an Ally
An ally is a character controlled by another player. Ironsworn moves are not intended to provoke or reinforce conflict between allies. Instead, the focus is on the drama and challenges of perilous quests in a harsh world. You and your allies will stand together against the forces which would see your vows unfulfilled. You are working towards shared (or at least complementary) goals.

That said, situations within the fiction may put you and an ally at odds. Your characters are not perfect. They may try to act rashly in a tense situation. They might stubbornly cling to a self-defeating approach or point of view. They might pursue their own vows at the cost of their relationships. Making nonoptimal choices as your character, creating more trouble for yourself, is part of dramatic storytelling.
### Conflict without Moves
Disagreements between characters can often be handled through roleplaying without engaging in moves. Talk it out, as your characters. Take care to not let this fictional conflict carry over into the real world.

If things get heated or uncomfortable, take a break. Discuss your approaches out-of-character, agree on next steps, and step back into the world to resolve the situation.
### Conflict Using Moves
If you are taking an action in opposition to an ally and want to resolve this conflict through a move, you can use this process:

- You both describe what you are doing to act against or resist your ally, and Face Danger (page 60) using an appropriate stat.
- If at least one of you scores a hit, determine who gains control of the outcome by comparing your level of success (strong hit > weak hit > miss). If you both have the same level of success, use your action score (you action die + stat + any adds) as a tie-breaker. If you are still tied, envision how your actions lead to a complete stalemate.
- Whoever gains control of the outcome decides which of the two moves should be resolved. The result of the other move is ignored.
- If neither of you scored a hit, resolve the miss for both moves. Each of you must Pay the Price.
The opposed Face Danger move provides a simple, fast mechanic for resolving conflicts between player characters. You can use a single exchange to decide the outcome of a quick action or an entire scene.

Use this process sparingly, and be considerate of not taking away control of another player’s character. Work together to interpret the outcome of the scene, with each player describing their character’s intent and reaction.

>[!example]-
>Having helped repel a raider attack, Tayla and Ash are attending a feast in the village longhouse. They sit across the table from each other, surrounded by drunken Ironlanders. Neither of them is feeling particularly celebratory.
>
>A man named Themon stands to make a toast. Ash and Tayla suspect he conspired with the raiders, but have little evidence. They grit their teeth as Themon raises his drink and praises the defenders of the village.
>
>Ash’s eyes narrow, and his expression grows hard as iron. “I can’t take any more of his lies. I’ll Draw the Circle and deal with this bastard.”
>
>“No,” Tayla says. “It’s not the right time. Themon has too many friends here. We need proof.”
>
>Ash is not convinced. “You see my hand going to my sword. Do you want to try to stop me?”
>
>“I want to try to calm you down,” Tayla says. “I’ll put my hand on your shoulder and see if I can talk some sense into you. Roll for it? I’ll Face Danger with heart.”
>
>“Let’s do it. I’ll roll iron as I try to shove your hand away. I want to stand up and challenge this guy.”
>
>They both make the move and roll the dice.
>
>Ash rolls a weak hit. Tayla rolls a strong hit, which gives her control of the outcome. She chooses to let her move stand. She is successful and takes +1 momentum.
>
>“I’ll take that strong hit,” Tayla says. “I’ve got my hand on your shoulder. I look you straight in the eyes and shake my head. I tell you that we’ll have our chance.”
>
>“My hand drifts away from my blade. I’ll let it be. For now.”
## Scene Challenges
A scene challenge is an optional approach you can use to resolve an extended challenge against an obstacle or NPCs. Examples of scene challenges include a chase on horseback, an archery contest, a formal debate before a council of elders, and leading an army into battle.
### Setting Up Your Scene Challenge
First, envision your goal for the scene and decide the rank of your challenge using the standard rank system: Troublesome, dangerous, formidable, extreme, or epic. A typical challenge is dangerous. Make it formidable if you are at a disadvantage, or troublesome if you have clear advantage. An extreme challenge is very tough to overcome, and an epic challenge is nearly hopeless.

Next, create a standard progress track with 10 boxes. When you mark progress, you fill in a standard number of boxes or ticks based on the rank of your challenge (page 14).

Then, create a separate track with only 4 boxes. This is your countdown track. When you mark the countdown track, you completely fill in a single box.

### Making Moves
Envision your action, and Face Danger or Secure an Advantage using whatever stat is most appropriate to the situation and your approach.

If you Face Danger:
- On a strong hit, you are successful. Mark progress per the rank of your challenge.
- On a weak hit, you are successful and mark progress. But, you also encounter a minor complication or delay. Envision what happens, and mark a countdown box to represent this setback.
- On a miss, you fail, or encounter a dramatic turn of events. Mark a countdown box and Pay the Price. 

If you Secure an Advantage:
- On a strong hit or weak hit, apply the outcome as per the move.
- On a miss, mark a countdown box and Pay the Price.

### Resolving the Scene Challenge
Continue to make moves, each time envisioning your approach, until either your countdown track is full (all 4 boxes are marked), or you decide you’re ready to resolve the scene. In either case, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress track. As with standard progress moves, you may not burn momentum on this roll, and you are not affected by negative momentum.

- On a strong hit, you achieve your goal unconditionally.
- On a weak hit, you succeed, but not without cost. You must Pay the Price. Make this a minor cost relative to the scope of the scene.
- On a miss, you fail, or your progress is undermined by a dramatic and costly turn of events. Pay the Price. Make it hurt.
### Working Together with Allies
Guided by the fiction, you can take turns making moves to give everyone a chance to participate in the challenge. Any allies involved in the scene can make the Face Danger or Secure an Advantage move. When they do, resolve the outcome of their move and mark progress and countdown boxes as appropriate. Any player can also make the Aid Your Ally move to contribute to a move another character is about to make.
### Let Slip the Dogs of War
If you are leading a large force of NPCs into battle, you can use a scene challenge to resolve the outcome. First, consider the makeup of the units on the field and give the challenge a rank.

- If you have a clear advantage, make it a troublesome challenge.
- If the forces are evenly matched and positioned, make it a dangerous challenge.
- If you are facing a superior force or are badly positioned, make it a formidable challenge.
- If you are facing overwhelming odds, make it an extreme or epic challenge.

Then, envision your approach as you lead your warband into battle. Face Danger or Secure an Advantage as appropriate, choosing a stat which represents the current situation and your tactics. Resolve the outcome of each move and mark the progress track and countdown track as normal.

During the battle, you can zoom in and resolve a fight against an important NPC or pack using combat moves. If you defeat this foe, mark progress on your scene progress track. If you lose the fight, mark a countdown box.
## Semi-Random Campaign Setup
To give fate a heavier hand in your character and starting situation, do the following:
1. Roll on the following table, and assign the +3 value to the result. Then, distribute the remaining stats (+2, +2, +1, +1) as you like.
   
| dice:1d% | Result                                              |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-20     | You are nimble, fast, and precise: Edge             |
| 21-40    | You are willful, courageous, and sociable: Heart    |
| 41-60    | You are strong, forceful, and imposing: Iron        |
| 61-80    | You are cunning, deceptive, and sneaky: Shadow      |
| 81-100   | You are smart, knowledgeable, and resourceful: Wits |
   
2. Gather the asset cards and organize them into decks by type (companion, path, combat talent, and ritual). Exclude any cards that don’t fit your vision for the setting (such as rituals if you aren’t including magic). Shuffle the individual decks and put them face down.
3. Choose a card from any deck. Don’t look at it. Pass the draw to the next player. Continue taking turns drawing a single asset from any deck until you have five in your hand.
4. Reveal your cards and choose two of them to discard. The remaining three cards are your character’s assets.
5. Ask the Oracle: “What is my background vow?” Then, spark an idea using the Character Goal oracle (page 182). Interpret the result, or roll on additional oracle tables to clarify as you like. Mark your background vow and give it a rank of extreme or epic.
6. Ask the Oracle: “Who do I share a bond with?” Then, roll once on the Character Role oracle (page 182) and twice on the Character Descriptor oracle (page 183). Envision this NPC, give them a name, and mark a bond. You may do this for your two remaining starting bonds, or come up with other bonds from scratch.
7. Together with the other players, Ask the Oracle: “What is our inciting incident?” Then, roll on the Settlement Trouble oracle (page 181). Interpret this answer to define your starting situation.

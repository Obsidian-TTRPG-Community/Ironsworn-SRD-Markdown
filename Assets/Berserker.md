## If you are clad only in animal pelts…
- When you Secure an Advantage or Compel by embodying your wild nature, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
- When you Strike or Clash by unleashing your rage (decide before rolling), inflict +1 harm on a hit. Then, choose one.• Push yourself: Endure Harm (1 harm).• Lose yourself: Endure Stress (1 stress).
- When you Endure Harm in a fight, and your health is above 0, you may let the pain inflame your wildness (decide before rolling). If you then score a strong hit and choose to embrace the pain, take +momentum equal to your remaining health. A weak hit counts as a miss.

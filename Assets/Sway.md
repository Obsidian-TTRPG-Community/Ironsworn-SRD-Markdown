Envision what you hear ([[Ask the Oracle]] if unsure). If you use this information or fulfill this need when you [[Compel]] them, you may reroll any dice (one time only). ON A WEAK HIT, as above, but this person’s need creates a troubling dilemma or complication; [[Endure Stress]] (1 stress).
- <input type="checkbox">As above, and if you score a strong hit when you [[Compel]], you may also reroll any dice (one time only) when you [[Gather Information]] from this person.

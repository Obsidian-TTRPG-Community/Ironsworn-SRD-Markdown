## Once you become corrupted...
- <input type="checkbox" checked>You harden your heart: Reduce your heart stat by 1 and add up to +2 to shadow (to a maximum of +4).
- <input type="checkbox">You are attuned to the realms of shadow: When you perform a ritual, add +1.
- <input type="checkbox">You know the sly ways of death: When you [[Face Death]], you may roll +shadow (instead of +heart). ON A WEAK HIT, if you choose to undertake a deathbound quest, you may roll +shadow (instead of +heart) and reroll any dice as you [[Swear an Iron Vow]]. When you [[Fulfill Your Vow]] on that quest and and mark experience, take +2 experience.

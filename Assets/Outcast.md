- <input type="checkbox" checked>When your supply is reduced to 0, suffer any remaining -supply as -momentum. Then, roll +wits. ON A STRONG HIT, you manage to scrape by and take +1 supply. ON A WEAK HIT, you may suffer -2 momentum in exchange for +1 supply. ON A MISS, you are [[Out of Supply]].
- <input type="checkbox">When you [[Sojourn]], you may reroll any dice. If you do (decide before your first roll), your needs are few, but your isolation sets you apart from others. A strong hit counts as a weak hit.
- <input type="checkbox">When you [[Reach Your Destination]] and score a strong hit, you recall or recognize something helpful about this place. Envision what it is, and take +2 momentum.

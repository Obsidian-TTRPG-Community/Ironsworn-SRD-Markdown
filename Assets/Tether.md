# Tether
#Asset/Ritual 

- <input type="checkbox" checked>When you commune with the spirits of a place, roll +heart. If you share a bond with someone there, add +1. ON A STRONG HIT, you are tethered. When you [[Undertake a Journey]] to return, you may roll +spirit or +heart (instead of +wits), and take +1 momentum on a hit. When you [[Reach Your Destination]], take +2 momentum on a strong hit. The tether is lost if you perform this ritual elsewhere, or when you Face Desolation. ON A WEAK HIT, as above, but the spirits reveal a disturbing aspect of the place; [[Endure Stress]] (2 stress).
- <input type="checkbox">As above, and you may also reroll any dice when you [[Sojourn]] in the tethered place.

## Once you Forsake Your Vow...

- <input type="checkbox" checked> This asset counts as a debility. One time only, when you [[Swear an Iron Vow]] to redeem yourself (extreme or greater), give that vow a special mark. When you [[Reach a Milestone]] on the marked vow, take +2 momentum.
- <input type="checkbox">When you [[Secure an Advantage]] or [[Compel]] by reaffirming your commitment to your marked vow, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
- <input type="checkbox">When you [[Fulfill Your Vow]] on your marked quest and score a hit, you find redemption and automatically activate this ability at no cost. You may then improve one of your stats by +1 and discard this asset.

# Bonded
#Asset/Path 
- When you make a move which gives you an add for sharing a bond, add +1 more.
- When you completely fill a box on your bonds progress track, envision what your relationships have taught you. Then, take 1 experience and +2 momentum.
- When you make a move in a crucial moment and score a miss, you may cling to thoughts of your bond-kin for courage or encouragement. If you do, reroll any dice. On another miss, in addition to the outcome of the move, you must mark shaken or corrupted. If both debilities are already marked, [[Face Desolation]].

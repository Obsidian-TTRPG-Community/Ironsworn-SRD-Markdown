# Communion
#Asset/Ritual 
- <input type="checkbox" checked>When you surround the remains of a recently deceased intelligent creature with lit candles, and summon its spirit, roll +heart. Add +1 if you share a bond. ON A STRONG HIT, the spirit appears and you may converse for a few minutes. Make moves as appropriate (add +1). ON A WEAK HIT, as above, but the spirit also delivers troubling news unrelated to your purpose. Envision what it tells you ([[Ask the Oracle]] if unsure) and [[Endure Stress]] (1 stress).
- <input type="checkbox">As above, and you may also commune with the long-dead.
- <input type="checkbox">When you perform this ritual, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

## If you wield a mighty hammer...
- <input type="checkbox" checked>When you [[Face Danger]], [[Secure an Advantage]], or [[Compel]] by hitting or breaking an inanimate object, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
- <input type="checkbox">When you Strike a foe to knock them back, stun them, or put them off balance, inflict 1 harm (instead of 2) and take +2 momentum on a hit. ON A STRONG HIT, you also create an opening and add +1 on your next move.
- <input type="checkbox">When you [[Turn the Tide]], you may [[Strike]] with all the fury and power you can muster. If you do (decide before rolling), you may reroll any dice and inflict +2 harm on a strong hit, but count a weak hit as a miss.

- <input type="checkbox" checked> When you [[Turn the Tide]], envision how your vows give you strength in this moment. Then, when you make your move, add +2 (instead of +1) and take +1 momentum on a hit.
- <input type="checkbox">When you [[Secure an Advantage]] or [[Compel]] by telling a hard truth, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit. On a weak hit or miss, envision how this truth complicates your current situation.
- <input type="checkbox">When you [[Fulfill Your Vow]] and score a miss, you may reroll one challenge die. If you score a miss again, reduce your maximum spirit by 1. You may recover this lost spirit when you next Fulfill Your Vow and score a strong hit.

# Shadow-Walk
#Asset/Ritual 

- <input type="checkbox" checked>When you cloak yourself with the gossamer veil of the shadow realms, roll +shadow. ON A STRONG HIT, take +1 momentum. Then, reroll any dice (one time only) when you make a move by ambushing, hiding, or sneaking. ON A WEAK HIT, as above, but the shadows try to lead you astray. You must first [[Face Danger]] to find your way.
- <input type="checkbox">As above, and you may also travel along the hidden paths of the shadowrealms to [[Undertake a Journey]] using+shadow (instead of +wits). If you do, [[Endure Stress]] (1 stress) and mark progress twice on a strong hit.
- <input type="checkbox">When you perform this ritual, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

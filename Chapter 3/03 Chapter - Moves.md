# Making Moves

Moves help you decide what happens when you do something risky or
uncertain, and they resolve various fictional and mechanical situations. There is a move for most common actions and scenes you will portray in Ironsworn. When you do something or encounter a situation within the scope of a move, refer to the move and follow its instructions to see what happens.

When a move is referenced within this rulebook or within another move, the move’s name will be italicized. When you see italicized text, it’s your prompt to make that move.

The Ironsworn moves are also available as a printable reference at
ironswornrpg.com. Refer to that handout during your session, and come back to this chapter when you need guidance or want more detail.
## ![[Move Outcomes]]

## Best Practices for Moves
### Fiction First, then Move
What are you trying to do? How are you doing it? What complications might you face? Envision it. If you’re playing co-op or guided, talk it out. If— after thinking through the fiction—you decide you are doing something or encountering a situation that falls under a move, make the move.

Depending on the scale of the current action, you might be visualizing a montage of days (a journey, for example) or the passing of a mere second (an intense fight). Always think from the standpoint of the fiction—even if it’s obvious what move you’ll make. Then, translate the fiction into the mechanics

of a move, and back to the fiction again as you play out the result. To learn more about how fiction and mechanics interact, see [[The Mechanics and the Fiction|page 203]]

### Not Everything is a Move
Don’t let your session jump from move to move without any roleplay, worldbuilding, or storytelling. If you’re doing something safe and certain, it’s probably not a move. If you’d rather gloss over something, do it.

Many moves offer a potential benefit and cost, and it’s ultimately your decision whether to risk the move to gain the reward. If you happen across a community in your travels, and decide to roleplay some low-key interactions with the locals, that’s not necessarily a move. However, if you are wounded

and low on supplies, [[Sojourn]] gives you an opportunity to recover. Moves are also used as a pacing mechanism. Moves leading immediately to other moves make the situation feel more intense and dangerous.

### Make Moves Matter
Let your moves flow organically out of the narrative. Don’t make moves purely for a mechanical benefit without some support in the fiction. Don’t repeat a move trying to get your desired outcome. A move, hit or miss, should always result in a change to the current situation.

>[!example]-
>You are trying to [[Compel]] a clan leader to agree to an alliance. You roleplay how you attempt to reason with them. Then, you make the roll, and fail. They refused. Why? What else do you learn or what do they do to make your situation more complex or dangerous? Whatever happens, something happens. You shouldn’t try to Compel them again unless you bring a new approach or leverage to bear.

However, there will be times when you make a move multiple times in sequence. In combat, you’ll often [[Strike]] or [[Clash]] with consecutive rolls. When you [[Undertake a Journey]], you may make the roll several times to gain progress. That’s fine as long as the rolls don’t get too mechanical. Break up the flow of play with other actions, narrative beats, and events that cause you to rethink your approach. When in doubt, follow this guideline: If you’ve made the same move three times in a row, switch things up. Make something happen.

## Making Group Moves
When you are adventuring with allies (other player characters), you will often make moves to resolve a challenge for the group. This represents your character taking the lead in a particular scene. You might serve as the spokesperson as you Compel an enemy to negotiate a surrender. Or, you might guide your party through a dense wood as you [[Undertake a Journey]]. Unless a move specifically offers benefits for your allies, any mechanical bonus you gain from a hit is applied only to the character making the move. For example, if you represent your group as you [[Swear an Iron Vow]] and score a strong hit, you take the mechanical reward (per the move, “take +2 momentum”). Everyone else benefits from the narrative success.

The exception are moves such as [[Make Camp]] and [[Sojourn]], which provide specific options for your allies to improve their status tracks or clear debilities. Also, your supply track is shared when you travel together, and any change (positive or negative) affects everyone in the group.

Allies can contribute to your action by making the [[Aid Your Ally]] move. On a hit, you gain a bonus you can leverage to improve your chance of success. If more than one ally makes this move, bonuses can be stacked.

When you make a move for your group and face a negative outcome, you should apply mechanical and narrative costs as appropriate to the current situation.

## Making Progress Moves
There are four progress moves: [[Reach Your Destination]], [[End the Fight]], [[Fulfill Your Vow]], and [[Write Your Epilogue]]. These moves represent your attempt to act decisively and resolve a challenge or complete a narrative arc. When you make these moves, you won’t roll your action die and add a stat. Instead, you tally your progress score by adding +1 for each fully filled progress box. Then, roll your challenge dice, compare to your progress score, and resolve the move as directed. You cannot burn momentum when making a progress move, and you are not affected by negative momentum.

To learn more about progress tracks and progress moves, see page 14.

## Equipment and Moves
Equipment and items can contribute to the fiction of how you make or avoid a move. What you wear or the items you carry might also affect how you envision your character. Otherwise, equipment is not especially important. To learn more about equipment for your character, see page 25 and page 45.

### Weapons and Armor
In combat, the weapons you wield and armor you wear mainly provide narrative detail for the scene. When you envision how you fight, take your equipment into account.

Weapons have implied characteristics. Light axes, knives, or spears can be thrown. A bow is fired. A sword is a fine weapon balanced for attack and defense. When you wield a spear, you leverage its reach to hold your opponent at bay or attack with speed and precision. When you fight with a knife, you move inside your opponent’s guard and slash and cut. When you hold a shield, you deflect blows, bash or shove your foe, or even block arrows at range.

Similarly, you can envision yourself relying on armor as you like. Do you wear crudely stitched hides for protection? Perhaps a fine shirt of mail handed down from your kin? Do you hide your face within a visored iron helm? How

does your armor affect your combat stance and tactics? You can lose a weapon, run out of ammo, or see your armor damaged as a result of a failed move.

This can be represented mechanically through a loss of momentum. Or, you might Endure Stress if an item of sentimental value is destroyed.

Losing access to a weapon also limits your ability to inflict harm (1 harm instead of 2—see page 19). Always start with the fiction. What moves does this item allow you to make or avoid? What happens when you no longer have it?

If you have a [[combat talents| combat talent asset]], your weapon and armor may provide additional benefit through abilities. As long as you carry the item, you may use those abilities.

# Fate Moves

^675b2e

In solo and co-op play, the fate moves mediate the result of other moves or serve as inspirational prompts for your story. When you face the outcome of a move, want to know what happens next, or have a question about people, places and events external to your character, the fate moves help you discover an answer.

In guided mode, your GM represents the whims of fate. They can reference these moves as they like, but they can also decide the outcome or direct the question back to you.

>[!tldr] There are three key aspects of using the fate moves:
>- Instinct: If an answer to a question or the result of a situation is obvious, interesting and dramatic, make it happen.
>- Randomness: You can roll on random tables to generate a result or answer a question.
>- Inspiration: You can use creative prompts, such as those included in the [[06 Chapter - Oracles|oracles chapter]] to guide your story.

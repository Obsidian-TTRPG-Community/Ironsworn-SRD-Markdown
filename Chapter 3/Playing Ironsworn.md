# Playing Ironsworn
In the Ironsworn tabletop roleplaying game, you are a hero  sworn to undertake periolous quests in the dark fantasy setting of the Ironlands. You will explore untracked wilds, fight desperate battles, forge bonds with isolated communities, and reveal the secrets of this hard land. Most importantly, you will swear iron vows and see them fulfilled - no matter the cost.

To play Ironsworn, you create your character, make some decisions about the world you inhabit, and set the story in motion. When you encounter something dangerous or uncertain, your choices and the dice determine the outcome.

> [!tldr] ### Three mods of Ironsworn
> - **Guided**: One or more players take the role of their characters, the protagonist in your story, while a gamemaster (GM) moderates the session. the GM helps bring the world to life, portays the people and creatures you encounter, and makes decisions about the outcome of your actions.
> - **Cooperative (Co-Op)**: You and one or more friends play together to overcome challenges and complete quests. A GM is not required. The Ironsworn game system will help you explore the dramatic stories of your characters and their faithful vows.
> - **Solo**: As with Co-Op, no GM is necessary. You portray a lone heroic character in a dangerous world. Good luck!


>Ironsworn is primarily intended for solo and small group play. One to four players (plus a GM in guided mode) is ideal. The characters portrayed by other players are referred to in these rules as your allies.

## What You Need
If you’re playing solo, just grab some materials and get started. A session can be as long as you like, from a few minutes to a few hours.

If you’re playing with one or more friends—either guided or co-op—you probably want to dedicate enough time to make some progress in your quests. Plan on a couple of hours or more.

> [!tldr] ### Make sure you have:
> - Two ten-sided dice (d10) for each player. These are your challenge dice.
> - One six-sided die (d6) for each player. This is your action die.
> - Optionally, another pair of ten-sided dice to use as your oracle dice.
> - A printed character sheet for each player and printed asset cards (available at ironswornrpg.com).
> - Some counters for marking status tracks on your character sheet. You can use paper clips, beads, dice, coins, tokens from other games, or whatever is convenient.

>Not required, but helpful: Printed reference sheets for moves, the blank Ironlands map, and other worksheets available at [ironswornrpg.com](http://ironswornrpg.com).

## The Mechanics and the Fiction
*Ironsworn* uses various **mechanics**, such as rolling dice and managing the stats and resources on your character sheet. As a player, you will often make decisions based on a desired mechanical outcome. For example, you might choose a particular action to get a bonus on your die roll. The basic mechanics of *Ironsworn* are introduced in this chapter.

*Ironsworn* is also heavily reliant on **the fiction**, which is the imagined characters, situations, and places within your game. You will play from the perspective of your character. You will interpret actions and events in a way that is consistent with the dramatic, fictional reality you have forged for your story and your world.

To learn more about how the mechanics and fiction interact, see [[The Mechanics and the Fiction]] in chapter 7.

## The Setting
The default setting for your adventures is the **Ironlands**. It is a rugged peninsula of isolated communities and untracked wilds on the frontier of the known world. You can learn more about the setting starting [[04 Chapter - Your World|Chapter 4]].
> [!tldr] For now, here’s a summary of some default assumptions.
> - Two generations ago, your people were driven to the Ironlands from their former homes in the Old World.
> - The weather here is harsh. Winters are brutal. The rugged terrain makes travel and trade difficult and dangerous. 
> - There are no thriving cities. Instead, Ironlanders live in isolated villages or steadings. Their homes are modest buildings of wood, stone, and thatch.
> - Many areas of the Ironlands are unexplored and uninhabited except by the firstborn—beings such as elves, giants, and the wolf-like varou.
> - Coins have little value here. Most commerce is made through barter and favors
> - Some communities remain isolated and independent, while others trade in basic goods such as iron, grain, wood, livestock, wool, and coal.
> - There is a diverse mix of peoples and cultures within the Ironlands, even within a single community. You can envision your character and those you interact with however you like, unbound by considerations of geography, lineage, sexual orientation, and gender.
> - Communities sometimes band together under a powerful leader, but there are no kingdoms. Territorial lines are sketchily drawn, if at all.
> - Large-scale warfare is unheard of, but raiding parties and skirmishes between communities are a constant menace. Some communities subsist entirely on raiding.
> - Spear, axe, shield, and bow are the dominant weapons. Swords are rare and highly prized. Some warriors choose to wade into battle clad in iron, while others trust in their prowess or in the strength of their shields.
> - Magic is subtle and mysterious. Mystics seek to ward away the darkness through the practice of magic, but often succumb to it. Rituals are performed as blessings and to gain insight.
> - Supernatural creatures and beasts are rare, frightening, and dangerous.

^setting

You are encouraged to make *Ironsworn* your own, and to bend the setting to your liking. Your version of the Ironlands will be unique because you’ll define aspects such as the history of your people, magic, mythic beasts, and more. The choices you make will help inspire the personal vows driving your character.

You can also ignore the Ironlands entirely and play in your own world, or explore a setting inspired by media, history, or another roleplaying game. The *Ironsworn* rules are flexible enough to accommodate many forms of gritty fantasy or historical fiction.

With a bit of work, you can even adapt these rules to different genres. [[Hacking Ironsworn|See here]] for more on hacking *Ironsworn*.

## Iron Vows
In the Ironlands, a vow is sacred. When you declare your solemn promise to serve or aid someone, or to complete a personal quest, your honor is bound to that vow. Abandoning or recanting an oath is the worst sort of failure.

When you swear a vow, you touch a piece of iron. It can be an iron coin, a weapon, or your armor. It’s an old tradition. Some say the iron, a piece of the primal world, serves as a conduit to the old gods—so they may better hear your promise.

Vows are the core of playing Ironsworn. It is your vows that drive you. These goals create the context for your adventures and challenges. As you complete vows, you gain experience and new abilities.

When you create your character, you start with a background vow. When you setup your campaign, you envision or encounter an inciting incident which triggers a new vow. There are several prompts for vows associated with the details of the world in [[04 Chapter - Your World|chapter 4]], and with foes and encounters in [[05 Chapter - Foes and Encounters|chapter 5]]. You can select something which fits your vision for the world and your character’s goals, or just come up with something yourself. If you are playing in co-op mode, you and your fellow players may have shared vows and personal vows.

To learn more about your first vows and starting your campaign, see [[07 Chapter - Gameplay in Depth|Starting Your Campaign]].

## Your Character
You use your character sheet to track your stats, overall condition, and progress in your quests. You also have [[#^0092da|assets]], which are abilities you choose when you create your character and when you gain experience. These components help you determine the outcome when things get dangerous or uncertain.

However, your character is more than these mechanical bits. You are the protagonist in a rich story. You have hopes and fears, virtues and failings. You have a history. You are, or were, part of a community. This is the fiction of your character. Consider a few of these details as you create your character, but don’t sweat it. You’ll evolve it through play. At the start of your game, put your character on stage to see what happens. Fill in the blanks—for your character and your world—as you go.

To learn more about creating your character and the components that make up your character, see [[02 Chapter - Your Character#^b467f9|You are Ironsworn]].

## Moves
Moves are self-contained systems to resolve a specific action, scene or question. There is a move for most common situations you encounter in Ironsworn. They have specific triggers, phrased as “When you [blank].” When your character does that thing, or you encounter that situation, refer to the move to see what happens.

> [!tldr] Moves are organized by activities.
> - [[03 Chapter - Moves#^2200d0|Adventure moves]] cover a variety of dangers, conducting investigations, traveling, making camp, and healing.
> - [[03 Chapter - Moves#^d7c2c2|Relationship moves]] involve persuading others to do something, building bonds with people and communities, resting and recuperating within a community, aiding your allies, and initiating duels.
> - [[03 Chapter - Moves#^4f97c9|Combat moves]] are used when fighting (but not exclusively; other moves may come into play as well).
> - [[03 Chapter - Moves#^ce1bdc|Suffer moves]] occur when you endure hardship, such as suffering physical harm or facing a dispiriting challenge.
> - [[03 Chapter - Moves#^29b239|Quest moves]] encompass iron vows, making progress in a sworn quest, and improving your character.
> - [[03 Chapter - Moves#^675b2e|Fate moves]] help you decide what happens in solo and co-op play, or support the GM’s decisions and brainstorming in guided play

^moves

When a move’s name is referenced within these rules or by another move, you’ll see it as italicized text.

Most moves are based on risky actions you are taking. You are attacking with your sword, making a dangerous climb, or healing an ally. These moves use dice to determine the outcome. This is called an [[#^yourdice|action roll]].

Some moves measure your headway against an extended challenge, such as a journey or fight, using a [[01 Chapter - The Basics#^26b116|progress track]]. When you are ready to resolve the challenge, you make a [[#^9e61ee|progress roll]].

Other moves utilize a different kind of dice roll, called an [[Oracles]] roll. These moves help determine the outcome of uncertain events out of your character’s control. If you’re playing solo or co-op, you can use the [[Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle]] to answer questions about the world, resolve how other characters respond, or determine what happens next.

Some moves don’t require a roll. They might support or reference a separate move, or simply help you resolve a mechanical or narrative situation. Don’t roll dice unless a move tells you to. See [[03 Chapter - Moves|chapter 3]] to learn more about moves.

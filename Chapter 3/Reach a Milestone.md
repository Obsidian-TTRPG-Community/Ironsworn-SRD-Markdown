You will face obstacles as you strive to complete quests. Some of these obstacles arise naturally out of the fiction of the situation. Overcoming one challenge leads naturally to the next. Others represent narrative twists introduced when you interpret the result of a move, or when you Ask the Oracle for inspiration. When you overcome one of these obstacles, and it was a notable challenge, make this move and mark progress on your quest.

Not every step on this path is worthy of a milestone. Did it put you in great danger? Did it cost you something significant? Did you unravel a complex web of clues and motivations? Was it dramatic and narratively interesting? Most importantly, was it directly related to your quest, and not a random or unconnected event?

How you define milestones determines the pace of your game. You need to overcome challenges to Reach a Milestone and mark progress. You can’t (with confidence) Fulfill Your Vow unless you’ve marked progress. You don’t gain experience unless you Fulfill Your Vow. You can’t add new assets to your character unless you gain experience. That’s the broad flow of how quests drive gameplay and character improvement, the tempo of which is determined by you and others at your table. If you come up against relatively simple obstacles and call them milestones, you’ll mark progress and move quickly toward completing the quest. But, if you do, you’ll miss out on storytelling opportunities and the satisfaction earned when you prevail against a worthy challenge.

Not sure if something is worthy as a milestone? If you’re playing co-op or guided, talk it out at the table. If you’re playing solo, trust your instincts and

the type of play experience you want to create. In the end, it’s your game. To learn more about milestones, see page 213.

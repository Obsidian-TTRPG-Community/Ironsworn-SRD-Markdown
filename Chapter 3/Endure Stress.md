>
>Then, roll +heart or +spirit, whichever is higher. 
>

^endurestress
Make this move when your courage fails you, when you are unnerved or disheartened, or when you act against your best intentions.

When you are forced to Pay the Price, you should Endure Stress if mental hardship is an obvious and dramatic outcome of the current situation. Also, some moves and assets will direct you to Endure Stress as a cost or concession, and may indicate a specific amount of stress to suffer.

If you are demoralized or frightened by an NPC foe, you can use their rank (page 134) to determine amount of stress you must suffer. If the amount of stress is not provided or obvious, use the following guidelines.
>[!fail] If you are demoralized or frightened:
>- Troublesome (1 stress): An unsettling incident or a frustrating failure.
>- Dangerous (2 stress): A distressing incident or an upsetting failure.
>- Formidable (3 stress): A horrifying incident or a demoralizing failure.
>- Extreme (4 stress): A heart-rending incident or traumatic failure.
>- Epic (5 stress): A soul-shattering incident or the loss of all hope.

>[!warning] If in doubt, make it dangerous (2 stress).

Next, reduce your spirit track by the amount suffered. If your spirit is at 0, apply any remaining -spirit to your momentum track. Then, roll.

On a strong hit, you are unfazed. You can suffer 1 less spirit or take +1 momentum. On a weak hit, you are rattled but carry on.

When you score a miss with 0 spirit, you need to make an important decision. Do you risk the potential for desolation by rolling on the oracle table, or mark a debility? The shaken debility (page 37) is temporary and can be dealt with through the Sojourn move, but becoming corrupted (page 38) is a permanent, life-altering event.

If you’ve scored a miss and your debilities are both marked, you must roll on the table to determine your fate.

## Move Outcomes
Most moves use an action roll (page 8) to resolve the outcome. Roll your action die and challenge dice, add the relevant stat to your action die along with any adds provided by the move or your assets, and check the result.
>[!tldr] Move Outcomes
>- **Strong hit**: When your action score is greater than both of the challenge dice, you succeed at what you are trying to do. Take any benefits as defined by the move. You are in control. Envision what you do next.
>- **Weak hit**: When your action score is greater than only one of the challenge dice, it’s a mixed result. You’ve probably succeeded, but with a lesser effect or a cost. The move will describe the outcome or choice you need to make. Control of the situation is slipping away. What happens next?
>- **Miss**: When your action score isn’t greater than either of the challenge dice, you failed or need to make a serious concession. The move will give you a specific result, or tell you to Pay the Price (page 105). You’ve lost control of the situation. What happens next?

A progress roll (page 18) is a variation of the action roll used to resolve an extended challenge. When you make a progress move, you won’t roll your action die. Instead, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress track. Then, check the result for a strong hit, weak hit, or miss.

Other moves leverage an oracle roll (page 22) to help guide the fiction. You’ll roll two ten-sided dice to generate a number between 1 and 100, and check your result against a table.

Some moves don’t use dice at all; don’t roll unless the move tells you to.

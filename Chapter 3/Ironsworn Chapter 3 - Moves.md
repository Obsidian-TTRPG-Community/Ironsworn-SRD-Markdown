# Making Moves

^5631b2

Moves help you decide what happens when you do something risky or
uncertain, and they resolve various fictional and mechanical situations. There is a move for most common actions and scenes you will portray in Ironsworn. When you do something or encounter a situation within the scope of a move, refer to the move and follow its instructions to see what happens.

When a move is referenced within this rulebook or within another move, the move’s name will be italicized. When you see italicized text, it’s your prompt to make that move.

The Ironsworn moves are also available as a printable reference at
ironswornrpg.com. Refer to that handout during your session, and come back to this chapter when you need guidance or want more detail.
[[Move Outcomes]]

## Best Practices for Moves
### Fiction First, then Move
What are you trying to do? How are you doing it? What complications might you face? Envision it. If you’re playing co-op or guided, talk it out. If— after thinking through the fiction—you decide you are doing something or encountering a situation that falls under a move, make the move.

Depending on the scale of the current action, you might be visualizing a montage of days (a journey, for example) or the passing of a mere second (an intense fight). Always think from the standpoint of the fiction—even if it’s obvious what move you’ll make. Then, translate the fiction into the mechanics

of a move, and back to the fiction again as you play out the result. To learn more about how fiction and mechanics interact, see page 203

### Not Everything is a Move
Don’t let your session jump from move to move without any roleplay, worldbuilding, or storytelling. If you’re doing something safe and certain, it’s probably not a move. If you’d rather gloss over something, do it.

Many moves offer a potential benefit and cost, and it’s ultimately your decision whether to risk the move to gain the reward. If you happen across a community in your travels, and decide to roleplay some low-key interactions with the locals, that’s not necessarily a move. However, if you are wounded

and low on supplies, Sojourn (page 71) gives you an opportunity to recover. Moves are also used as a pacing mechanism. Moves leading immediately to other moves make the situation feel more intense and dangerous.

### Make Moves Matter
Let your moves flow organically out of the narrative. Don’t make moves purely for a mechanical benefit without some support in the fiction. Don’t repeat a move trying to get your desired outcome. A move, hit or miss, should always result in a change to the current situation.

For example, you are trying to Compel (page 69) a clan leader to agree to an alliance. You roleplay how you attempt to reason with them. Then, you make the roll, and fail. They refused. Why? What else do you learn or what do they do to make your situation more complex or dangerous? Whatever happens, something happens. You shouldn’t try to Compel them again unless you bring a new approach or leverage to bear.

However, there will be times when you make a move multiple times in sequence. In combat, you’ll often Strike (page 79) or Clash (page 80) with consecutive rolls. When you Undertake a Journey (page 65), you may make the roll several times to gain progress. That’s fine as long as the rolls don’t get too mechanical. Break up the flow of play with other actions, narrative beats, and events that cause you to rethink your approach. When in doubt, follow this guideline: If you’ve made the same move three times in a row, switch things up. Make something happen.

## Making Group Moves
When you are adventuring with allies (other player characters), you will often make moves to resolve a challenge for the group. This represents your character taking the lead in a particular scene. You might serve as the spokesperson as you Compel an enemy to negotiate a surrender. Or, you might guide your party through a dense wood as you Undertake a Journey. Unless a move specifically offers benefits for your allies, any mechanical bonus you gain from a hit is applied only to the character making the move. For example, if you represent your group as you Swear an Iron Vow (page 98) and score a strong hit, you take the mechanical reward (per the move, “take +2 momentum”). Everyone else benefits from the narrative success.

The exception are moves such as Make Camp and Sojourn, which provide specific options for your allies to improve their status tracks or clear debilities. Also, your supply track is shared when you travel together, and any change (positive or negative) affects everyone in the group.

Allies can contribute to your action by making the Aid Your Ally move (page 76). On a hit, you gain a bonus you can leverage to improve your chance of success. If more than one ally makes this move, bonuses can be stacked.

When you make a move for your group and face a negative outcome, you should apply mechanical and narrative costs as appropriate to the current situation.

## Making Progress Moves
There are four progress moves: Reach Your Destination (page 68), End the Fight (page 82), Fulfill Your Vow (page 101), and Write Your Epilogue (page 77). These moves represent your attempt to act decisively and resolve a challenge or complete a narrative arc. When you make these moves, you won’t roll your action die and add a stat. Instead, you tally your progress score by adding +1 for each fully filled progress box. Then, roll your challenge dice, compare to your progress score, and resolve the move as directed. You cannot burn momentum when making a progress move, and you are not affected by negative momentum.

To learn more about progress tracks and progress moves, see page 14.

## Equipment and Moves
Equipment and items can contribute to the fiction of how you make or avoid a move. What you wear or the items you carry might also affect how you envision your character. Otherwise, equipment is not especially important. To learn more about equipment for your character, see page 25 and page 45.

### Weapons and Armor
In combat, the weapons you wield and armor you wear mainly provide narrative detail for the scene. When you envision how you fight, take your equipment into account.

Weapons have implied characteristics. Light axes, knives, or spears can be thrown. A bow is fired. A sword is a fine weapon balanced for attack and defense. When you wield a spear, you leverage its reach to hold your opponent at bay or attack with speed and precision. When you fight with a knife, you move inside your opponent’s guard and slash and cut. When you hold a shield, you deflect blows, bash or shove your foe, or even block arrows at range.

Similarly, you can envision yourself relying on armor as you like. Do you wear crudely stitched hides for protection? Perhaps a fine shirt of mail handed down from your kin? Do you hide your face within a visored iron helm? How

does your armor affect your combat stance and tactics? You can lose a weapon, run out of ammo, or see your armor damaged as a result of a failed move.

This can be represented mechanically through a loss of momentum. Or, you might Endure Stress if an item of sentimental value is destroyed.

Losing access to a weapon also limits your ability to inflict harm (1 harm instead of 2—see page 19). Always start with the fiction. What moves does this item allow you to make or avoid? What happens when you no longer have it?

If you have a combat talent asset (page 40), your weapon and armor may provide additional benefit through abilities. As long as you carry the item, you may use those abilities.

## Other Moves in Combat
You won’t rely solely on combat moves in a fight. Make other moves as appropriate to the situation, your intent, and the actions of your foes.

### [[Face Danger]]
>[!example] Make this move when you seek to avoid or overcome an obstacle in combat, or when you choose to focus on defense.
>- You leap over a gully as you ride into battle. Face Danger +edge.
>- The massive elder bear roars, spittle flying. Will you muster your courage against this terrifying beast? Face Danger +heart. 
>- You bring up your shield as the raider presses their attack, standing your ground against the withering axe blows. Face Danger +iron.

If this is a proactive move—you are overcoming an obstacle—make it when you have initiative. If this is a reactive move—you are trying to avoid an immediate threat—your foe likely has the initiative.

When would you Face Danger instead of Clash against an attack? If you are fighting back, that’s probably Clash. If you focusing on defense, getting out of the way, ducking behind your shield, or taking cover, that’s Face Danger. It’s less risky, since you can leverage a favored stat and the penalty on a weak hit is relatively mild. Unlike Clash, you won’t have an opportunity to inflict immediate harm on a hit, but a strong hit with Face Danger can put you in good position for a follow-up move.

You’ll also likely Face Danger if your foe is trying to gain advantage through an action other than a direct attack. They move to the trees to get a shot at you from cover. Or they taunt you, trying to provoke you into a reckless response. Perhaps they shove at you, putting you off-balance for a follow-up attack. What do you do? Envision it, then make the move. If you fail to score a hit, you likely suffer a loss of momentum to represent this setback. Your foe has initiative and will try to press their advantage.

Face Danger might also be used to flee combat altogether. If you have a path and means to escape, make this move to see if you get away.

Finally, in cases where an enemy represents a minor obstacle, Face Danger can be used to avoid combat or as a means of resolving your action against a mundane foe. For example, you can Face Danger to sneak past an enemy or run away from a potential fight. If you are dealing with a minor foe from a position of clear advantage, such as firing an arrow from hiding, you can Face Danger to see what happens. In either case, a miss

on this move might force you to Enter the Fray.
### [[Secure an Advantage]]
>[!example] This move is made in combat when you try to gain some leverage, improve your position, or setup another move. For example:
>- You take careful aim before shooting. Secure an Advantage +wits.
>- You perform a sly feint, trying to put your opponent off balance and create an opening. Secure an Advantage +shadow.
>- You attempt to dishearten your foe with an intimidating roar as you charge. Secure an Advantage +iron.

Secure an Advantage can be used whenever you have initiative, or as a means of establishing a favorable position prior to the fight. Mechanically, it’s a powerful move for building your momentum track toward a decisive action. Narratively, it’s a great way to bring cinematic action into the scene.

When you want to Secure an Advantage, picture the situation. Consider the terrain, your weapons, your position, and your fighting style and approach. Consider your enemy, and their tactics and readiness. Where is there an opportunity? Envision your action, then make the move.

### [[Compel]]
Compel can be used as a shortcut to ending a combat. You don’t have to make the End the Fight move to surrender or negotiate a truce. End the Fight is the outcome of a desperate, probably bloody, skirmish. 

>[!example] If you or your foe have other objectives, give Compel a try.
>- You attempt to force your foe to surrender. Compel +iron.
>- You try to surrender, reason or negotiate. Compel +heart.
>- You trick your foe into giving up the fight. Compel +shadow.

Compel needs to be supported by the fiction. What is your foe’s intent? How do they feel about you? Are you a hated enemy? A potential meal? What are they willing to risk to end you? Has the fight gone in their favor or against them? What leverage do you have? If there’s no upside for them, you can’t make this move. If you aren’t sure, Ask the Oracle before you Compel.

Compel might be used proactively (when you have initiative) or reactively (when your foe has it) depending on the circumstances. Offering to surrender is a reactive response, and can be done when you don’t have initiative. Attempting to Compel your foe to give up the fight is a proactive move made when you are in control.

### [[Aid Your Ally]]
This move is an obvious choice when you want to bolster your ally’s actions. Envision what you do to help them, make the Secure an Advantage move, and let them take the benefits of the outcome.

You should have initiative before you attempt to Aid Your Ally. On a strong hit, both of you then take or retain initiative. This is a huge advantage for your ally if they were having a difficult time making progress against their foe. On a weak hit or miss, you both lose initiative.

### [[Suffer Moves]]
Make Suffer moves as appropriate when you face the outcome of your actions within a combat scene.

If you make a suffer move and score a strong hit, you may take or retain initiative—even if you scored a weak hit or miss on the preceding move. However, this opportunity does not overrule the fiction of the moment. If you are out of action and Face Death, you aren’t likely to come springing back into the fight. If you do score a strong hit on a suffer move, consider what happens next and the moves you may make in the context of the situation.

### [[Pay the Price]]
Being forced to make the Endure Harm move is the obvious result when you must Pay the Price in a fight, but there’s much more that can happen in a dynamic combat situation. You lose your footing. You drop your weapon. Your shield is shattered. A goal is lost to you. A companion or ally is injured. You are put in a perilous position. A new threat reveals itself.

Mix it up. Make combat exciting and cinematic. Whatever happens, make the outcome one you wish you had avoided. If in doubt, roll on the Pay the Price table or Ask the Oracle.

### [[Ask the Oracle]]
In solo and co-op play, you can Ask the Oracle about your foe’s objectives, tactics, and specific actions. The oracle can also help determine the outcome of events or introduce new twists.

Use this move sparingly. For the most part, trust your instincts. Your actions trigger reactions. Who are you fighting? What do they want? What do they do next? Your first impulse is often the right one.

Chapter 6 includes the Combat Action oracle (page 188) which you can use to prompt an NPC action or response in a fight. You can also leverage the description of your foe’s tactics in chapter 5 (page 133) to guide their behavior.

Be mindful of your surroundings and other characters. Ask questions. “Can I take cover here?”, “Is the river shallow enough to cross?”, “Do the villagers flee?” Consider your foe’s actions and your opportunities in the context of the environment.

In guided play, the GM is your oracle. When you have questions about what happens next, look to them, or talk it out at the table. Your GM is free to use the Ask the Oracle move to answer questions.

# Fate Moves

^675b2e

In solo and co-op play, the fate moves mediate the result of other moves or serve as inspirational prompts for your story. When you face the outcome of a move, want to know what happens next, or have a question about people, places and events external to your character, the fate moves help you discover an answer.

In guided mode, your GM represents the whims of fate. They can reference these moves as they like, but they can also decide the outcome or direct the question back to you.

>[!tldr] There are three key aspects of using the fate moves:
>- Instinct: If an answer to a question or the result of a situation is obvious, interesting and dramatic, make it happen.
>- Randomness: You can roll on random tables to generate a result or answer a question.
>- Inspiration: You can use creative prompts, such as those included in the oracles chapter (page 165) to guide your story.

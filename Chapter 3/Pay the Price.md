This is one of the most common moves in *Ironsworn*. Make this move when directed to by the outcome of another move, or when the current situation naturally leads to a cost through your choices of actions.

First, **choose an option as described in the move.** You may determine the outcome yourself, [[Ask the Oracle]] to decide between two options, or roll on the table. In a guided play, you look to your GM for a ruling. Whatever choice you make, always follow the fiction. If a dramatic outcome springs to mind immediately, go with it.

Next, **envision the outcome.** What happens? How does it impact the current situation and your character? Apply the outcome to the fiction of your scene before you determine any mechanical impact. Focusing on the narrative cost leads to deeper, more dramatic stories.

Finally, 
>[!tldr] Apply any appropriate mechanical penalty:
>- If you place a physical hardship or injury, [[Endure Harm]] and suffer -health.
>- If you are disheartneed or frightened, [[Endure Stress]] and suffer -spirit.
>- If you lose equipment or exhaust resources, suffer -supply.
>- If you waste previous moments or are put in an unfavorable position, suffer -momentum.
>- If an ally or companion is put in harm's way, apply the cost to them.
See [[Move Glossary]] for guidelines on mechanical costs. When in doubt, suffer =2 from the appropriate track.

Most situations can impact both the narrative situation and your mechanical status. But, a result might also be purely narrative without an immediate mechanical cost. An initial failure might introduce a complication or force a reactive move (such as [[Face Danger]]). A failure on a subsequent move can then introduce a mechanical penalty. In this way, failures build on each other, and the situation gets riskier and more intense.

The narrative and mechanical costs you endure should be appropriate to the circumstances and the move you are making. Scoring a miss on [[End the Fight]] implies a greater cost than if you fail to [[Clash]] within that scene. For dramatic moments and decisive moves, up the stakes.

once you've resolved the outcome, **envision what happens next** and how you react. You are not in control. the situation is more complex and dangerous. You may need to respond with another move to restore your advantage and avoid further cost.

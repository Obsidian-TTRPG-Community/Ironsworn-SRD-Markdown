### Move Glossary
There are several common phrases, terms, and prompts you’ll see as part of moves and assets. They are summarized here (in alphabetical order).

“ADD +X”

Add this number to your action die. This is in addition to any other bonuses you otherwise receive, such as your stat. Your action die + your stat + adds is your final action score. See page 8 for details.

“ALLIES / ALLY”

An ally (page 25) is a character controlled by another player.

[[Ask the Oracle]]

When you seek inspiration to decide the outcome of a move, resolve what happens next, or get details about your world, you can Ask the Oracle (page 107). This move lets you ask questions to get a yes/no result or use random prompts for brainstorming. When you are playing with a GM, they are the oracle. Ask them what happens, or talk it out.

“COMPANION”

A companion (page 25) is an NPC asset.

“CHOOSE”

The move will provide a list of options and the number you may select. You may not select a single option more than once.

“ENDURE HARM (X HARM)”

Make the Endure Harm move (page 91), reducing your health track by the indicated amount of harm.

“ENDURE STRESS (X STRESS)”

Make the Endure Stress move (page 95), reducing your spirit track by the indicated amount of stress.

“IN EXCHANGE FOR”

Adjust the appropriate tracks by the amount indicated in the move. Typically, you will trade +1 in one track for -1 in another.

“INFLICT YOUR HARM”

When you inflict your harm (page 19), you mark progress against your foe. If you are armed with a deadly weapon (such as a sword, axe, spear, or bow), you inflict 2 harm. If you are unarmed or using an improvised or simple weapon (such as a shield, stick, club, staff, or rock), you inflict 1 harm.

Each point of harm you inflict is marked as progress on your foe’s progress track, as appropriate to their rank. For example, each point of harm equals 2 ticks when fighting an extreme enemy, or 2 full progress boxes when fighting a dangerous enemy.

“INFLICT +X HARM”

“Inflict +1 Harm” tells you to add 1 harm to your current attack. Some assets increase your harm in particular circumstances, or a move might give you an option to increase your harm. You must inflict harm as a result of your move to gain the bonus. Always add your harm and any bonus harm together, then apply it to your foe’s progress track.

“ON A HIT” / “IF YOU SCORE A HIT”

Act on these instructions if you score a weak or strong hit on a move (your move score beats one or both of the challenge dice).

“ON A WEAK HIT” / “IF YOU SCORE A WEAK HIT”

Act on these instructions if your move score is greater than one challenge die, but less than or equal to the other.

“ON A STRONG HIT” / “IF YOU SCORE A STRONG HIT”

Act on these instructions if your move score is greater than both challenge dice.

“ON A MISS” / “IF YOU SCORE A MISS”

Act on these instructions if your move score does not beat either of the challenge dice.

“PAY THE PRICE”

When you roll a miss on a move, you’ll usually see a prompt to Pay the Price. This move (page 105) helps you resolve the outcome of failure. If you’re playing without a GM, you make the most obvious or interesting bad outcome happen based on the current circumstances, roll on the Pay the Price table to see what happens, or Ask the Oracle (page 107). If you’re playing with a GM, they can decide what happens, ask you to roll on the table, or talk it with the group.

“PROGRESS MOVE”

This is a special type of move to resolve the outcome of a goal or challenge. When you make a progress move, tally the number of filled boxes on your progress track as your progress score. Only add fully filled boxes (those with four ticks). Then, roll your challenge dice, compare to your progress score,

and resolve a strong hit, weak hit, or miss as normal. You may not burn momentum on this roll, and you are not affected by negative momentum. To learn more about progress tracks and progress moves, see page 14.

“REROLL ANY DICE”

After you roll your move, you may pick up and reroll your choice of any dice, including either or both of the challenge dice and your action die. Set aside the dice you intend to keep. You may only reroll once, using a single throw for all dice you choose to reroll. Choose carefully, because the new result for all dice must stand.

“ROLL +[STAT]”

Add the value of the indicated stat to your action die. This is the basic action roll (page 8). Most moves indicate the stat you should use, such as “roll +iron”. If it doesn’t, or gives you a choice, use the most appropriate stat.

“SUFFER -X”

Subtract this number from the indicated track. For example, “Suffer -1 supply” tells you to subtract 1 from your supply track. If a specific amount is open to interpretation, reduce the track as appropriate to the challenge faced.

| Rank        | Amount |
| ----------- | ------ |
| Troublesome | -1     |
| Dangerous   | -2     |
| Formidable  | -3     |
| Extreme     | -4     |
| Epic        | -5       |

When you are fighting a foe, they inflict harm and stress based on their rank. For example, a formidable foe inflicts 3 harm or stress.

When in doubt about the amount you suffer, just assume it is a dangerous result and adjust the associated track by -2.

“TAKE +X”

Add this number to the indicated track. For example, “Take +2 momentum” tells you to add 2 to your current momentum track.

Some assets may offer additional bonuses. Unless stated otherwise, this bonus is added to anything else you gain as a result of your move. If you take +2 momentum as part of a move, and you are using an asset which gives you +1 momentum on the same move, you take +3 momentum total.

“WHEN YOU…”

This is the move trigger. When you do this thing, or encounter this situation, make the move. Only you, the character, makes moves. You or the GM don’t use moves for non-player characters or creatures. If you’re just checking to see if something happens or how someone acts, you can Ask the Oracle (page 105).

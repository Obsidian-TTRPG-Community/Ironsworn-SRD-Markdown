# Suffer Moves

These moves are made as a result of a perilous event or bad outcome on other moves. They represent what happens to you, and how you hold up against the trauma.

>[!tldr] Suffer Moves
>- When you face physical damage, make the [[Endure Harm]] move.
>- When you score a miss on the Endure Harm move, and your health is at 0, you may need to [[Face Death]].
>- When your companion is exposed to harm, make the [[Companion Endure Harm]] move.
>- When you are demoralized, afraid, or acting against your best intentions, make the [[Endure Stress]] move.
>- When you score a miss on the Endure Stress move, and your spirit is at 0, you may need to [[Face Desolation]].
>- When your supply falls to 0, all characters make the [[Out of Supply]] move. If you are at 0 supply and suffer additional -supply, you each need to reduce your health, spirit, or momentum tracks by that amount.
>- When your momentum track is at its minimum (-6), and you suffer additional -momentum, make the [[Face a Setback]] move.

Making a suffer move is not, however, the only possible outcome of a failure. You might face story complications or new dangers.

You might lose an item. Your relationship with another character might be tested. Keep it fresh and interesting. When in doubt, [[Ask the Oracle]].

# Joining Forces with NPCs
If your story leads you to cooperating with helper NPCs to overcome challenges, you need to consider how they impact the fiction and your moves. NPCs—unless they are a [[Asset Types|companion asset]]—won’t give you mechanical bonuses on your moves. They also won’t make moves of their own. They are simply a part of your story, perhaps impacting the moves you make, the results of those moves, and the rank of your challenges. Gaining the aid of an important NPC might also allow you to [[Reach a Milestone]].

>[!example] For example:
>- If you are charged with protecting NPCs, they might be placed in danger or suffer losses as a result of your failures on moves.
>- If you are fighting alongside NPCs, you can reduce the rank of your foes. For example, battling alone against a large pack of raiders might be an extreme challenge. If you are aided by a stalwart band of villagers, you could shift the enemies’ rank to formidable.
>- If you are being led by an experienced scout, you might choose to skip the Undertake a Journey move, or reduce the rank of the journey.
>- If an NPC leader agrees to support your quest by allowing passage through contested lands, you might Reach a Milestone and mark progress.

As with any NPC, you can [[Ask the Oracle]] to see how a helper NPC responds, how they fare in a challenge, or what they do next. You can make moves to influence them, such as [[Compel]]. If you develop a strong relationship through your story, or if you [[Fulfill Your Vow]] in their service, you can choose to [[Forge a Bond]].

In short, make them characters, not numbers. Give them personalities. Give them quirks and motivations. Let them impact your story and your quests, for better or worse, but always keep the focus on your character and your allies.

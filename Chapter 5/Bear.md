Most bears are not aggressive. They avoid Ironlanders and are unlikely to attack unless they see you as a threat.

There are exceptions. The silver bears of the Veiled Mountains, which sometimes range as far south as the Tempest Hills, are territorial, powerful, and aggressive. Likewise, the ash bear, encountered in woodlands throughout the Ironlands, is known for its ferocity and cunning. If either catch your scent, they are likely to hunt you down and attack.

> A group of hunters felled a large ash bear with several arrows. It tumbled into a river and was swept away. Unfortunately, the bear they thought dead is now stalking the group as they make their way back home.

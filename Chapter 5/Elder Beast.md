Elder beastsâ€”including wolves, bears, and boarsâ€”are huge, monstrous versions of their common kin. They are primarily solitary creatures, though elder wolves have been known to lead a pack of normal wolves. Some call them guardians, avatars of the land itself, and say they are as long-lived as the oldest trees.

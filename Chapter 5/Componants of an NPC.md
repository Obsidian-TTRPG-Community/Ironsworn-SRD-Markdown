Because gameplay in Ironsworn is centered on the abilities and actions of your character, NPCs are primarily represented through your fiction rather than mechanics. They don’t have stats, assets, or tracks. Instead, the sample NPCs in this chapter include some broad details to help guide their actions and the threat they pose in combat.

When you interact with an NPC, envision their personality and motivations. A brutish character leverages their strength, or attempts to bully and intimidate. A sly character acts through manipulation or trickery. A noble character behaves according to their sense of honor. An animal, depending on its disposition, may attack when threatened or may run away. A supernatural being may act with mindless malice and hate for the living, or may have more complex needs. When you are unsure of an NPC’s traits or next action, [[Ask the Oracle]]. Then, envision what they do and make moves to aid or oppose them as appropriate.

### Rank
NPCs have a single mechanical attribute, their rank. From this, their ability to resist and inflict [[01 Chapter - The Basics#^f66007|harm]] in combat is derived, as follows:

| Rank         | Type                                      | Progress           | Harm            |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Troublesome  | Common enemies                            | 3 progressper harm | Inflicts 1 harm |
| Dangerous    | Capable fighters and deadly creatures     | 2 progressper harm | Inflicts 2 harm |
| Formidable   | Exceptional fighters and mighty creatures | 1 progressper harm | Inflicts 3 harm |
| Extreme      | Foes of overwhelming skill or power       | 2 ticks perharm    | Inflicts 4 harm |
| Epic         | Legendary foes of mythic power            | 1 tick perharm     | Inflicts 5 harm |
^table

When you engage a foe in combat, give them a standard progress track (10 boxes). When you Strike or Clash and inflict harm, mark progress for each point of harm based on the foe’s rank. For example, you mark 2 ticks for each point of harm inflicted on an extreme foe, and 2 progress (2 full boxes) for each point of harm against a dangerous foe.

When you fail to defend against a foe’s attack and face physical harm, you make the [[Endure Harm]] move. As part of that move, you reduce your health track by the amount of harm your foe inflicts, per their rank. If appropriate to the NPC, they can also inflict [[Stress]] equal to their rank when you fail to resist an action which frightens, demoralizes, or rattles you. Use the [[End the Fight]] move, adding your progress against this foe, when you attempt to resolve the combat. See [[01 Chapter - The Basics#^2b5624|progress]] to learn more.

> The ranks for the sample NPCs in this chapter represent a typical individual of that type. For unusually powerful NPCs, increase their rank by one (to a maximum of epic). For less powerful foes, decrease their rank by one (to a minimum of troublesome). You can also adjust the rank of a foe when circumstances give you significant narrative disadvantage or advantage before the fight. See page 208 for more on adjusting challenge ranks.

### Features

These are the typical characteristics of appearance and personality for an NPC. They are not universally true, especially within diverse societies such as Ironlanders and the firstborn, but can provide some common impressions as a starting point.

### Drives

Drives reflect the motivations and instincts of an NPC. For creatures, these are relatively simple: Hunt, eat, defend territory. For intelligent beings, drives are the typical goals and beliefs of their society, but do not represent the complex range of motivations you will encounter. Drives are a starting place, giving you the rough outline of a typical NPC to be fleshed out (or contradicted) appropriate to their role in the fiction.

NPCs who are prominent in your campaign will have more detail. Depending on their role in your story, their drives may support—or conflict with—your own goals. As you discover details about an important NPC, make note of it. Look for opportunities to introduce interesting and surprising backstories and motivations for these characters.

### Tactics

Tactics provide a reference for how an NPC might act in combat. These give you a sense of typical maneuvers, but do not represent the possibilities of a complex and dramatic combat scene. You should let NPC actions flow out of the fiction. What is the situation? What is their goal? What will add to the excitement and danger of this moment? Make it happen. When in doubt, Ask the Oracle.

Your foes should do more than simply try to inflict harm. A fearsome roar or demoralizing boast might cause you to Endure Stress. Tactical maneuvers reduce your momentum. Fictional complications—the appearance of new foes, putting companions or allies at risk, or a realization that undermines your quest—will heighten the drama of the scene.

### Quest Starter

All NPCs include a quest starter, which can serve as inspiration for one of your vows.

### Your Truth

Some NPCs include a question for you to answer. This is an opportunity to customize the NPC to your vision of the Ironlands. You can do this as you define your world or discover through play. Truths may represent an absolute fact, or merely something the people of your world believe.

^npcchimera

A chimera is the corrupted form of dead animal flesh given horrible life. Its body is a collection of various creatures, fused together into a twisted, massive entity which knows only pain and hunger. When a dozen blood-tinged eyes focus on you, when its gibbering mouths open at once to scream, your only hope is a quick death.

# NPCs in the Ironlands
An NPC (non-player character/creature) is anyone who inhabits your version of the Ironlands other than your character and those portrayed by your fellow players. They can be a person, being or creature. You will roleplay your interactions with NPCs, and make moves when you attempt to influence them, aid them, gain their help, or act against them.

>[!tldr] This chapter includes a variety of sample NPCs, organized by category.
>- The Ironlanders are the humans who have settled these lands.
>- The Firstborn are beings who walked the Ironlands uncountable years before humans arrived.
>- Animals are common creatures.
>- Beasts are monstrous creatures of unusual size and cunning.
>- Horrors are supernatural beings.

These NPCs are a starting place. Use what fits your version of the Ironlands, keeping in mind the choices you made when you defined the characteristics of your setting in the previous chapter. If your world is entirely humancentric, ignore any fantastical NPCs. If you want to boost the fantasy in your campaign, you can emphasize the unreal or monstrous.

Use what you like. Discard what you don’t. Create what is missing. It’s your world.

## Joining Forces with NPCs
If your story leads you to cooperating with helper NPCs to overcome challenges, you need to consider how they impact the fiction and your moves. NPCs—unless they are a companion asset (page 39)—won’t give you mechanical bonuses on your moves. They also won’t make moves of their own. They are simply a part of your story, perhaps impacting the moves you make, the results of those moves, and the rank of your challenges. Gaining the aid of an important NPC might also allow you to Reach a Milestone (page 100).

>[!example] For example:
>- If you are charged with protecting NPCs, they might be placed in danger or suffer losses as a result of your failures on moves.
>- If you are fighting alongside NPCs, you can reduce the rank of your foes. For example, battling alone against a large pack of raiders might be an extreme challenge. If you are aided by a stalwart band of villagers, you could shift the enemies’ rank to formidable.
>- If you are being led by an experienced scout, you might choose to skip the Undertake a Journey move, or reduce the rank of the journey.
>- If an NPC leader agrees to support your quest by allowing passage through contested lands, you might Reach a Milestone and mark progress.

As with any NPC, you can Ask the Oracle to see how a helper NPC responds, how they fare in a challenge, or what they do next. You can make moves to influence them, such as Compel. If you develop a strong relationship through your story, or if you Fulfill Your Vow in their service, you can choose to Forge a Bond.

In short, make them characters, not numbers. Give them personalities. Give them quirks and motivations. Let them impact your story and your quests, for better or worse, but always keep the focus on your character and your allies.

## Creating NPCs
You should create NPCs that fit your version of the Ironlands, enhance your story, and enrich your character’s adventures. Use the sample NPCs as a starting place, or start from scratch. Because NPCs don’t have mechanical detail, it’s easy to bring them to life without advance preparation.

If you face an NPC in combat, give them a rank. If you like, you can also make note of their drives and tactics. Otherwise, their motivations, abilities, and actions are entirely part of your fiction. They may ignore you, aid you, or oppose you. Make moves to resolve your intentions with them as appropriate. Springboard off those moves with new details and complications to flesh out these characters.

For reoccurring NPCs, make note of what you learn of them over time. If you share a bond, mark it down.

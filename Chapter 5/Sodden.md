A sodden is the restless spirit of someone who drowned or was put to rest in water. They can appear in seas, rivers, lakes, ponds, or marshes. Their loneliness and grief compels them to draw living victims into their watery lairs.

A sodden is not confined to its resting place. In fact, some believe that surviving an encounter with a sodden leaves you vulnerable around any body of water until the spirit finishes its work.

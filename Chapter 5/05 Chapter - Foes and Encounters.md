# NPCs in the Ironlands
An NPC (non-player character/creature) is anyone who inhabits your version of the Ironlands other than your character and those portrayed by your fellow players. They can be a person, being or creature. You will roleplay your interactions with NPCs, and make moves when you attempt to influence them, aid them, gain their help, or act against them.

>[!tldr] This chapter includes a variety of sample NPCs, organized by category.
>- The Ironlanders are the humans who have settled these lands.
>- The Firstborn are beings who walked the Ironlands uncountable years before humans arrived.
>- Animals are common creatures.
>- Beasts are monstrous creatures of unusual size and cunning.
>- Horrors are supernatural beings.

These NPCs are a starting place. Use what fits your version of the Ironlands, keeping in mind the choices you made when you defined the characteristics of your setting in the previous chapter. If your world is entirely humancentric, ignore any fantastical NPCs. If you want to boost the fantasy in your campaign, you can emphasize the unreal or monstrous.

Use what you like. Discard what you don’t. Create what is missing. It’s your world.

## Creating NPCs
You should create NPCs that fit your version of the Ironlands, enhance your story, and enrich your character’s adventures. Use the sample NPCs as a starting place, or start from scratch. Because NPCs don’t have mechanical detail, it’s easy to bring them to life without advance preparation.

If you face an NPC in combat, give them a rank. If you like, you can also make note of their drives and tactics. Otherwise, their motivations, abilities, and actions are entirely part of your fiction. They may ignore you, aid you, or oppose you. Make moves to resolve your intentions with them as appropriate. Springboard off those moves with new details and complications to flesh out these characters.

For reoccurring NPCs, make note of what you learn of them over time. If you share a bond, mark it down.

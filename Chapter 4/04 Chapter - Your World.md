# Welcome to the Ironlands
The Ironlands is a vast peninsula in the northern ocean. The people who now refer to themselves as Ironlanders settled here two generations ago, cast out of their homelands by a catastrophic event. Since that time, thy have survived but not prospered. The Ironlandsare a harsh, dangerous place. The winters are long and brutal. Harvests are uncertain. Depending on the choices you make as you create your version of the Ironlands, monstrous beasts and dreaded horrors may be a constant threat.

This chapter includes a brief summary for each major region of the Ironlands. It also includes a section wehre you define the characteristics, dangers, and mythology of your own Ironlands, creating a setting customized to your vision and preferences.

The detail here is intentionally light. Consider it a sketch on a canvas, ready to be adorned with the vibrant colors and details of your story.

## Travel in the Ironlands
When traveling through dangerous or unknown areas, make the [[Undertake a Journey]] move. You will set the rank of the journey as appropriate to the fictional circumstances—the distance, region, terrain, threats, and your character’s readiness. You should also consider its importance in your quest. A higher rank means more storyline dedicated to the journey. If you want to move quicker to your destination, give it a lower rank. If this journey represents an important aspect of your character’s story, or you want to create opportunities for interesting events and side quests, give it a higher rank. 

>[!tldr] When in doubt, refer to the following for general guidelines, or [[Ask the Oracle]].
>- Traveling a moderate distance within a single region is Troublesome.
>- Traveling a long distance within a single region, or across rough terrain, is Dangerous.
>- Traveling from one region to another, or across especially challenging terrain, is Formidable.
>- Traveling through multiple regions is Extreme.
>- Traveling from one end of the Ironlands to another, or to a separate land,is Epic.

Generally, don’t sweat it. Travel should move at the speed of your story. Don’t worry about exact measurements for distance or time. Give your journey a rank appropriate to the circumstances and your story, and make the move to see what happens.

# Mapping Your Journey
To keep track of the details of your world, download the blank Ironlands map at ironswornrpg.com. Then, use a separate sheet, index cards, or a journal to create a key for the locations on your map.

Index cards work great. They give you space for a reasonable amount of information for a region or location, and it’s quick and easy to dig through them to find details on-demand. Just mark the index card with a number, and mark that same number in the proper location on your Ironlands map. If you store your index cards in order, clipped to your map, it’ll take all of a couple of seconds to remind yourself, “What was the name of that village in the Hinterlands?”

You can even use these index cards for random events. Need to know where the raiders are headed? Shuffle your index cards, turn them face down, and draw one.

Don’t worry about the details here. Not everything you encounter needs to be marked on the map or recorded. Focus on the people and places important to your story. Don’t fuss with distances or exact positioning. There are no extra points awarded for neatness. That said, if you really enjoy detailed maps and recording your journeys, feel free to do so in whatever form works best for you.

If you’re using your own map for the Ironlands or playing in a different setting altogether, you can manage the details however you like.

When you record the details of a community, include a note for any bonds you share. In the example below, (B) is used to signify a bond. The index cards can also be used to keep track of related quests.

This is a working Obsidian Source Reference Document (OSRD) for [Ironsworn](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/), created by Shawn Tomkin.

I have converted and linked all the rules into markdown setting and plan to make charactersheets and screen for playing the game.

This vault requires [Dataview by blacksmithgu](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) and [Diceroller by valentine195](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller) to work properly and I will update this README as I add on other plugins required for you to play the game.
